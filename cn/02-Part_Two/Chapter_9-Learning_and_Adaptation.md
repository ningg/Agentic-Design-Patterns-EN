# Chapter 9: Learning and Adaptation

> 第 9 章：学习与适应

Learning and adaptation are pivotal for enhancing the capabilities of artificial intelligence agents. These processes enable agents to evolve beyond predefined parameters, allowing them to improve autonomously through experience and environmental interaction. By learning and adapting, agents can effectively manage novel situations and optimize their performance without constant manual intervention. This chapter explores the principles and mechanisms underpinning agent learning and adaptation in detail.

> 学习与适应是提升人工智能体能力的关键。这些过程使智能体得以突破预设参数，经由经验与环境互动自主改进，从而有效应对新情境、优化表现，而无需持续人工干预。本章将深入阐述支撑智能体学习与适应的原理与机制。

## The Big Picture

> ## 全景

Agents learn and adapt by changing their thinking, actions, or knowledge based on new experiences and data. This allows agents to evolve from simply following instructions to becoming smarter over time.

> 智能体基于新经验与新数据调整其思考方式、行为策略或知识结构，由此实现学习与适应，并从机械执行指令逐步演进为能够随时间持续优化的系统。

* **Reinforcement Learning:** Agents try actions and receive rewards for positive outcomes and penalties for negative ones, learning optimal behaviors in changing situations. Useful for agents controlling robots or playing games.  
* **Supervised Learning:** Agents learn from labeled examples, connecting inputs to desired outputs, enabling tasks like decision-making and pattern recognition. Ideal for agents sorting emails or predicting trends.  
* **Unsupervised Learning:** Agents discover hidden connections and patterns in unlabeled data, aiding in insights, organization, and creating a mental map of their environment. Useful for agents exploring data without specific guidance.  
* **Few-Shot/Zero-Shot Learning with LLM-Based Agents:** Agents leveraging LLMs can quickly adapt to new tasks with minimal examples or clear instructions, enabling rapid responses to new commands or situations.  
* **Online Learning:** Agents continuously update knowledge with new data, essential for real-time reactions and ongoing adaptation in dynamic environments. Critical for agents processing continuous data streams.  
* **Memory-Based Learning:** Agents recall past experiences to adjust current actions in similar situations, enhancing context awareness and decision-making. Effective for agents with memory recall capabilities.

> * **强化学习：** 尝试动作，对好结果得奖励、坏结果受惩罚，在变化情境中学习最优行为；适用于控制机器人或玩游戏等智能体。
> * **监督学习：** 从标注样本学习输入到期望输出的映射，支持决策与模式识别等；适合分拣邮件或预测趋势的智能体。

Agents adapt by changing strategy, understanding, or goals based on learning. This is vital for agents in unpredictable, changing, or new environments.

> 智能体还会因学习而改变策略、理解或目标，这在不可预测、变化或全新的环境中至关重要。

**Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** is a reinforcement learning algorithm used to train agents in environments with a continuous range of actions, like controlling a robot's joints or a character in a game. Its main goal is to reliably and stably improve an agent's decision-making strategy, known as its policy.

> **近端策略优化（PPO）** 是一种强化学习算法，适用于动作空间连续的场景（例如控制机器人关节或游戏角色）；其主旨是在可靠、稳定的前提下改进智能体的决策策略。

The core idea behind PPO is to make small, careful updates to the agent's policy. It avoids drastic changes that could cause performance to collapse. Here's how it works:

> PPO 的核心是对策略做小步、谨慎的更新，避免剧烈变化导致性能崩溃。工作方式如下：

1. Collect Data: The agent interacts with its environment (e.g., plays a game) using its current policy and collects a batch of experiences (state, action, reward).  
2. Evaluate a "Surrogate" Goal: PPO calculates how a potential policy update would change the expected reward. However, instead of just maximizing this reward, it uses a special "clipped" objective function.  
3. The "Clipping" Mechanism: This is the key to PPO's stability. It creates a "trust region" or a safe zone around the current policy. The algorithm is prevented from making an update that is too different from the current strategy. This clipping acts like a safety brake, ensuring the agent doesn't take a huge, risky step that undoes its learning.

> 1. **收集数据：** 智能体以当前策略与环境交互（如玩游戏），收集一批（状态、动作、奖励）轨迹。
> 2. **评估替代目标（surrogate）：** PPO 估算一次策略更新会如何改变期望奖励；但并非一味最大化该量，而是借助带「裁剪」的替代目标函数。
> 3. **裁剪机制：** 这是 PPO 稳定性的关键：在当前策略周围划定「信任域」或安全区，禁止更新与现行策略偏离过大；裁剪如同安全阀，避免智能体迈出过大、冒险的一步而毁掉已得进展。

In short, PPO balances improving performance with staying close to a known, working strategy, which prevents catastrophic failures during training and leads to more stable learning.

> 简言之，PPO 在提升性能与贴近已知可行策略之间取得平衡，减少训练中的灾难性失败，使学习更稳定。

**Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)** is a more recent method designed specifically for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. It offers a simpler, more direct alternative to using PPO for this task.

> **直接偏好优化（DPO）** 是较新的方法，专用于将大语言模型与人类偏好对齐；相对用 PPO 完成该任务，它更简单、更直接。

To understand DPO, it helps to first understand the traditional PPO-based alignment method:

> 理解 DPO 前，宜先了解传统的基于 PPO 的对齐方法：

* The PPO Approach (Two-Step Process):  
  1. Train a Reward Model: First, you collect human feedback data where people rate or compare different LLM responses (e.g., "Response A is better than Response B"). This data is used to train a separate AI model, called a reward model, whose job is to predict what score a human would give to any new response.  
  2. Fine-Tune with PPO: Next, the LLM is fine-tuned using PPO. The LLM's goal is to generate responses that get the highest possible score from the reward model. The reward model acts as the "judge" in the training game.

> * **PPO 路径（两步）：**
>   1. **训练奖励模型：** 收集人类对不同回复的评分或比较数据（如「A 比 B 好」），训练单独的奖励模型，预测人类会给新回复打多少分。
>   2. **用 PPO 微调：** 再用 PPO 微调 LLM，使其生成在奖励模型看来得分最高的回复；奖励模型在训练中充当「裁判」。

This two-step process can be complex and unstable. For instance, the LLM might find a loophole and learn to "hack" the reward model to get high scores for bad responses.

> 两步流程可能既复杂又不稳定：例如 LLM 可能利用奖励模型的漏洞，让质量欠佳的回复仍获得较高评分。

* The DPO Approach (Direct Process): DPO skips the reward model entirely. Instead of translating human preferences into a reward score and then optimizing for that score, DPO uses the preference data directly to update the LLM's policy.  
* It works by using a mathematical relationship that directly links preference data to the optimal policy. It essentially teaches the model: "Increase the probability of generating responses like the *preferred* one and decrease the probability of generating ones like the *disfavored* one."

> * **DPO 路径（直接）：** 完全跳过奖励模型；不先把偏好变成奖励分数再优化，而是直接用偏好数据更新 LLM 策略。
> * 借助将偏好数据与最优策略直接关联的数学关系，实质上教模型：**提高**生成*被偏好*回复的概率，**降低**生成*不被偏好*回复的概率。

In essence, DPO simplifies alignment by directly optimizing the language model on human preference data. This avoids the complexity and potential instability of training and using a separate reward model, making the alignment process more efficient and robust.

> 本质上，DPO 直接依据人类偏好数据优化语言模型，从而简化对齐流程：绕开单独训练奖励模型及其在环调用所带来的复杂性与不稳定，使对齐路径更短、更稳。

## Practical Applications & Use Cases

> ## 实践应用与用例

Adaptive agents exhibit enhanced performance in variable environments through iterative updates driven by experiential data.

> 自适应智能体借助由经验数据驱动的迭代更新，在多变环境中表现更强。

* **Personalized assistant agents** refine interaction protocols through longitudinal analysis of individual user behaviors, ensuring highly optimized response generation.  
* **Trading bot agents** optimize decision-making algorithms by dynamically adjusting model parameters based on high-resolution, real-time market data, thereby maximizing financial returns and mitigating risk factors.  
* **Application agents** optimize user interface and functionality through dynamic modification based on observed user behavior, resulting in increased user engagement and system intuitiveness.

## Case Study: The Self-Improving Coding Agent (SICA)

> ## 案例研究：自改进编程智能体（SICA）

The Self-Improving Coding Agent (SICA), developed by Maxime Robeyns, Laurence Aitchison, and Martin Szummer, represents an advancement in agent-based learning, demonstrating the capacity for an agent to modify its own source code. This contrasts with traditional approaches where one agent might train another; SICA acts as both the modifier and the modified entity, iteratively refining its code base to improve performance across various coding challenges.

> 由 Maxime Robeyns、Laurence Aitchison 与 Martin Szummer 开发的**自改进编程智能体（SICA）** 体现了基于智能体学习的进展：智能体能够修改自身源码。这与「一个智能体训练另一个」的传统路径不同——SICA 同时是修改者与被修改对象，通过迭代精炼代码库以在多种编程挑战上提升表现。

SICA's self-improvement operates through an iterative cycle (see Fig.1). Initially, SICA reviews an archive of its past versions and their performance on benchmark tests. It selects the version with the highest performance score, calculated based on a weighted formula considering success, time, and computational cost. This selected version then undertakes the next round of self-modification. It analyzes the archive to identify potential improvements and then directly alters its codebase. The modified agent is subsequently tested against benchmarks, with the results recorded in the archive. This process repeats, facilitating learning directly from past performance. This self-improvement mechanism allows SICA to evolve its capabilities without requiring traditional training paradigms.

> SICA 的自改进依托迭代闭环（见图 1）：先回顾历史版本及其基准表现，按成功率、耗时与算力成本等加权打分，选出最优版本作为下一轮改动的起点；该版本分析档案、寻找可改进之处并直接改写代码库，随后新版本再次跑分入库。循环往复，使改进直接锚定在可观测的表现上；由此，SICA 不必依赖传统离线训练范式也能持续演进。

Fig.1: SICA's self-improvement, learning and adapting based on its past versions

> 图 1：SICA 基于过往版本的自改进、学习与适应

SICA underwent significant self-improvement, leading to advancements in code editing and navigation. Initially, SICA utilized a basic file-overwriting approach for code changes. It subsequently developed a "Smart Editor" capable of more intelligent and contextual edits. This evolved into a "Diff-Enhanced Smart Editor," incorporating diffs for targeted modifications and pattern-based editing, and a "Quick Overwrite Tool" to reduce processing demands.

> SICA 经多轮自改进，在代码编辑与导航上进展明显：起初以整文件覆盖等基础方式改代码；随后发展出更智能、更具情境感的「Smart Editor」；再演化为结合 diff 做定向修改与模式编辑的「Diff-Enhanced Smart Editor」，以及用于降低处理负担的「Quick Overwrite Tool」。

SICA further implemented "Minimal Diff Output Optimization" and "Context-Sensitive Diff Minimization," using Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing for efficiency. Additionally, a "SmartEditor Input Normalizer" was added. In terms of navigation, SICA independently created an "AST Symbol Locator," using the code's structural map (AST) to identify definitions within the codebase. Later, a "Hybrid Symbol Locator" was developed, combining a quick search with AST checking. This was further optimized via "Optimized AST Parsing in Hybrid Symbol Locator" to focus on relevant code sections, improving search speed.(see Fig. 2)

> SICA 还实现「Minimal Diff Output Optimization」与「Context-Sensitive Diff Minimization」，借助 AST 解析提高效率；并加入「SmartEditor Input Normalizer」。导航方面，它独立创建「AST Symbol Locator」，用代码结构图（AST）在代码库中定位定义；后又发展「Hybrid Symbol Locator」，结合快速搜索与 AST 校验；再通过「Optimized AST Parsing in Hybrid Symbol Locator」聚焦相关代码段以提速（见图 2）。

> 图 2：各迭代上的性能表现；关键改进标注了对应的工具或智能体修改。（Maxime Robeyns、Martin Szummer、Laurence Aitchison 提供）

SICA's architecture comprises a foundational toolkit for basic file operations, command execution, and arithmetic calculations. It includes mechanisms for result submission and the invocation of specialized sub-agents (coding, problem-solving, and reasoning). These sub-agents decompose complex tasks and manage the LLM's context length, especially during extended improvement cycles.

> SICA 的架构包含基础文件操作、命令执行与算术等工具集，也包含结果提交机制以及专用子智能体（编程、解题、推理）的调用能力；这些子智能体负责拆解复杂任务，并在长期改进循环中帮助管理 LLM 的上下文长度。

An asynchronous overseer, another LLM, monitors SICA's behavior, identifying potential issues such as loops or stagnation. It communicates with SICA and can intervene to halt execution if necessary. The overseer receives a detailed report of SICA's actions, including a callgraph and a log of messages and tool actions, to identify patterns and inefficiencies.

> 异步监督者（另一 LLM）监控 SICA 行为，识别循环或停滞等问题；可与 SICA 通信并在必要时中止执行；监督者收到含调用图与消息/工具动作日志的详细报告，以识别模式与低效之处。

SICA's LLM organizes information within its context window, its short-term memory, in a structured manner crucial to its operation. This structure includes a System Prompt defining agent goals, tool and sub-agent documentation, and system instructions. A Core Prompt contains the problem statement or instruction, content of open files, and a directory map. Assistant Messages record the agent's step-by-step reasoning, tool and sub-agent call records and results, and overseer communications. This organization facilitates efficient information flow, enhancing LLM operation and reducing processing time and costs. Initially, file changes were recorded as diffs, showing only modifications and periodically consolidated.

> SICA 的 LLM 以结构化方式组织上下文窗口（短期记忆）中的信息，对其运行至关重要：系统提示定义目标、工具与子智能体文档及系统指令；核心提示含问题陈述或指令、打开文件内容与目录图；助手消息记录逐步推理、工具与子智能体调用及结果、以及与监督者的通信。该组织促进信息流效率、改善 LLM 运行并降低时延与成本。起初文件变更以 diff 记录，仅显示修改并定期合并。

**SICA: A Look at the Code:** Delving deeper into SICA's implementation reveals several key design choices that underpin its capabilities. As discussed, the system is built with a modular architecture, incorporating several sub-agents, such as a coding agent, a problem-solver agent, and a reasoning agent. These sub-agents are invoked by the main agent, much like tool calls, serving to decompose complex tasks and efficiently manage context length, especially during those extended meta-improvement iterations.

> **SICA：实现剖面：** 深入其实现可见若干关键设计：模块化架构、多个子智能体（编程、解题、推理等）；主智能体像调用工具一样调度它们，以分解复杂任务并高效管理上下文，尤其适用于漫长的元改进迭代。

The project is actively developed and aims to provide a robust framework for those interested in post-training LLMs on tool use and other agentic tasks, with the full code available for further exploration and contribution at the [https://github.com/MaximeRobeyns/self_improving_coding_agent/](https://github.com/MaximeRobeyns/self_improving_coding_agent/) GitHub repository.

> 项目在积极开发中，旨在为希望在工具使用及其他智能体任务上对 LLM 做后训练的人提供稳健框架；完整代码见 [GitHub 仓库](https://github.com/MaximeRobeyns/self_improving_coding_agent/) 以供探索与贡献。

For security, the project strongly emphasizes Docker containerization, meaning the agent runs within a dedicated Docker container. This is a crucial measure, as it provides isolation from the host machine, mitigating risks like inadvertent file system manipulation given the agent's ability to execute shell commands.

> 安全方面，项目强调 Docker 容器化：智能体在专用容器中运行，与宿主机隔离，缓解其能执行 shell 命令时误操作文件系统等风险。

To ensure transparency and control, the system features robust observability through an interactive webpage that visualizes events on the event bus and the agent's callgraph. This offers comprehensive insights into the agent's actions, allowing users to inspect individual events, read overseer messages, and collapse sub-agent traces for clearer understanding.

> 为透明与可控，系统通过交互网页提供强可观测性：可视化事件总线上的事件与智能体调用图，便于检视单次事件、阅读监督者消息、折叠子智能体轨迹以理清脉络。

In terms of its core intelligence, the agent framework supports LLM integration from various providers, enabling experimentation with different models to find the best fit for specific tasks. Finally, a critical component is the asynchronous overseer, an LLM that runs concurrently with the main agent. This overseer periodically assesses the agent's behavior for pathological deviations or stagnation and can intervene by sending notifications or even cancelling the agent's execution if necessary. It receives a detailed textual representation of the system's state, including a callgraph and an event stream of LLM messages, tool calls, and responses, which allows it to detect inefficient patterns or repeated work.

> 在模型侧，框架可对接多家 LLM 提供商，便于按任务试错选型。另一关键组件是异步监督者：与主智能体并行运行，周期性检视是否陷入循环、停滞或异常路径，必要时发通知甚至终止运行；它拿到的是系统状态的文本化快照——含调用图以及 LLM 消息、工具调用与响应构成的事件流——据此识别低效与重复劳动。

A notable challenge in the initial SICA implementation was prompting the LLM-based agent to independently propose novel, innovative, feasible, and engaging modifications during each meta-improvement iteration. This limitation, particularly in fostering open-ended learning and authentic creativity in LLM agents, remains a key area of investigation in current research.

> 初期 SICA 实现中一大挑战是：如何在每次元改进迭代中提示基于 LLM 的智能体独立提出新颖、可行且吸引人的修改。在促进开放式学习与 LLM 智能体真实创造力方面，该局限仍是当前研究的重要课题。

## AlphaEvolve and OpenEvolve

> ## AlphaEvolve 与 OpenEvolve

**AlphaEvolve** is an AI agent developed by Google designed to discover and optimize algorithms. It utilizes a combination of LLMs, specifically Gemini models (Flash and Pro), automated evaluation systems, and an evolutionary algorithm framework. This system aims to advance both theoretical mathematics and practical computing applications.

> **AlphaEvolve** 是 Google 开发的 智能体，用于发现与优化算法；结合 LLM（Gemini Flash 与 Pro）、自动评估系统与进化算法框架，旨在推进理论数学与实用计算应用。

AlphaEvolve employs an ensemble of Gemini models. Flash is used for generating a wide range of initial algorithm proposals, while Pro provides more in-depth analysis and refinement. Proposed algorithms are then automatically evaluated and scored based on predefined criteria. This evaluation provides feedback that is used to iteratively improve the solutions, leading to optimized and novel algorithms.

> AlphaEvolve 使用 Gemini 模型组合：Flash 生成大量初始算法提案，Pro 做更深入分析与精炼；提案再按预设标准自动评估打分，反馈用于迭代改进，得到优化且新颖的算法。

In practical computing, AlphaEvolve has been deployed within Google's infrastructure. It has demonstrated improvements in data center scheduling, resulting in a 0.7% reduction in global compute resource usage. It has also contributed to hardware design by suggesting optimizations for Verilog code in upcoming Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Furthermore, AlphaEvolve has accelerated AI performance, including a 23% speed improvement in a core kernel of the Gemini architecture and up to 32.5% optimization of low-level GPU instructions for FlashAttention.

> 在实用计算中，AlphaEvolve 已部署于 Google 基础设施：数据中心调度改进使全球算力使用约降 0.7%；通过为下一代 TPU 的 Verilog 代码提优化建议参与硬件设计；还加速 AI 性能，包括在 Gemini 架构某核心内核上约 23% 提速，以及对 FlashAttention 的低级 GPU 指令最高约 32.5% 的优化。

In the realm of fundamental research, AlphaEvolve has contributed to the discovery of new algorithms for matrix multiplication, including a method for 4x4 complex-valued matrices that uses 48 scalar multiplications, surpassing previously known solutions. In broader mathematical research, it has rediscovered existing state-of-the-art solutions to over 50 open problems in 75% of cases and improved upon existing solutions in 20% of cases, with examples including advancements in the kissing number problem.

> 在基础研究方面，AlphaEvolve 助力发现矩阵乘法新算法，其中包括对 4×4 复矩阵仅用 48 次标量乘法、优于此前已知结果的方法；在更广的数学研究中，对 50 余个开放问题约有 75% 复现了已知最优解、约 20% 改进了既有解，接吻数等问题即为一例。

**OpenEvolve** is an evolutionary coding agent that leverages LLMs (see Fig.3) to iteratively optimize code. It orchestrates a pipeline of LLM-driven code generation, evaluation, and selection to continuously enhance programs for a wide range of tasks. A key aspect of OpenEvolve is its capability to evolve entire code files, rather than being limited to single functions. The agent is designed for versatility, offering support for multiple programming languages and compatibility with OpenAI-compatible APIs for any LLM. Furthermore, it incorporates multi-objective optimization, allows for flexible prompt engineering, and is capable of distributed evaluation to efficiently handle complex coding challenges.

> **OpenEvolve** 是利用 LLM（见图 3）迭代优化代码的进化式编程智能体；编排由 LLM 驱动的代码生成、评估与选择流水线，持续增强面向广泛任务的程序。其要点之一是能进化**整个代码文件**，而非仅限单函数；设计强调通用性：多语言、任意兼容 OpenAI API 的 LLM；并含多目标优化、灵活提示工程与分布式评估，以应对复杂编程挑战。

![OpenEvolve Architecture](../assets-new/OpenEvolve_Architecture.png)

Fig. 3: The OpenEvolve internal architecture is managed by a controller. This controller orchestrates several key components: the program sampler, Program Database, Evaluator Pool, and LLM Ensembles. Its primary function is to facilitate their learning and adaptation processes to enhance code quality.

> 图 3：OpenEvolve 内部架构由控制器管理；控制器协调程序采样器、程序数据库、评估器池与 LLM 集成等组件，主要功能是促进其学习与适应过程以提升代码质量。

This code snippet uses the OpenEvolve library to perform evolutionary optimization on a program. It initializes the OpenEvolve system with paths to an initial program, an evaluation file, and a configuration file. The evolve.run(iterations=1000) line starts the evolutionary process, running for 1000 iterations to find an improved version of the program. Finally, it prints the metrics of the best program found during the evolution, formatted to four decimal places.

> 以下代码片段使用 OpenEvolve 库对程序做进化优化：用初始程序、评估文件与配置文件路径初始化系统；`evolve.run(iterations=1000)` 启动进化过程，运行 1000 次迭代以寻找改进版本；最后打印进化过程中最优程序的指标，保留四位小数。

```python
from openevolve import OpenEvolve


# Initialize the system
evolve = OpenEvolve(
    initial_program_path="path/to/initial_program.py",
    evaluation_file="path/to/evaluator.py",
    config_path="path/to/config.yaml",
)

# Run the evolution
best_program = await evolve.run(iterations=1000)

print("Best program metrics:")
for name, value in best_program.metrics.items():
    print(f"  {name}: {value:.4f}")
```

## At a Glance

> ## 一览

**What:** AI agents often operate in dynamic and unpredictable environments where pre-programmed logic is insufficient. Their performance can degrade when faced with novel situations not anticipated during their initial design. Without the ability to learn from experience, agents cannot optimize their strategies or personalize their interactions over time. This rigidity limits their effectiveness and prevents them from achieving true autonomy in complex, real-world scenarios.

> **问题：** 智能体常运行在动态、不可预测的环境中，单靠预编程逻辑往往不足；一旦遇到设计阶段未覆盖的新情境，系统表现就可能明显下滑。若不能从经验中学习，便无法持续优化策略或逐步实现个性化交互，这种僵化会直接限制其有效性，并阻碍其在复杂真实场景中实现真正的自主运行。

**Why:** The standardized solution is to integrate learning and adaptation mechanisms, transforming static agents into dynamic, evolving systems. This allows an agent to autonomously refine its knowledge and behaviors based on new data and interactions. Agentic systems can use various methods, from reinforcement learning to more advanced techniques like self-modification, as seen in the Self-Improving Coding Agent (SICA). Advanced systems like Google's AlphaEvolve leverage LLMs and evolutionary algorithms to discover entirely new and more efficient solutions to complex problems. By continuously learning, agents can master new tasks, enhance their performance, and adapt to changing conditions without requiring constant manual reprogramming.

> **思路：** 标准做法是将学习与适应机制融入系统，把静态智能体变为动态演进系统；使其能基于新数据与交互自主精炼知识与行为。智能体系统可采用从强化学习到自修改等进阶技术（如 SICA）；Google AlphaEvolve 等系统结合 LLM 与进化算法发现全新、更高效的复杂问题解法。持续学习使智能体能掌握新任务、提升表现、适应变化，而无需不断手工重编程。

**Rule of thumb:** Use this pattern when building agents that must operate in dynamic, uncertain, or evolving environments. It is essential for applications requiring personalization, continuous performance improvement, and the ability to handle novel situations autonomously.

> **经验法则：** 构建须在动态、不确定或演进环境中运行的智能体时使用本模式；对需要个性化、持续性能改进及自主应对新情境的应用尤为关键。
