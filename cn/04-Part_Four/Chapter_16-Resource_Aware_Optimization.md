# Chapter 16: Resource-Aware Optimization

> 第十六章：资源感知优化

Resource-Aware Optimization enables intelligent agents to dynamically monitor and manage computational, temporal, and financial resources during operation. This differs from simple planning, which primarily focuses on action sequencing. Resource-Aware Optimization requires agents to make decisions regarding action execution to achieve goals within specified resource budgets or to optimize efficiency. This involves choosing between more accurate but expensive models and faster, lower-cost ones, or deciding whether to allocate additional compute for a more refined response versus returning a quicker, less detailed answer.

> 资源感知优化让智能体在运行期持续感知并调度计算、时间与资金消耗。它区别于只管「先做什么、后做什么」的简单规划：智能体须在具体执行层面做权衡——在既定预算内达成目标，或主动追求更高性价比——例如在「更准但更贵」与「更快更省」的模型间选型，或在「多加算力换更细答复」与「尽快给出够用答案」之间取舍。

For example, consider an agent tasked with analyzing a large dataset for a financial analyst. If the analyst needs a preliminary report immediately, the agent might use a faster, more affordable model to quickly summarize key trends. However, if the analyst requires a highly accurate forecast for a critical investment decision and has a larger budget and more time, the agent would allocate more resources to utilize a powerful, slower, but more precise predictive model. A key strategy in this category is the fallback mechanism, which acts as a safeguard when a preferred model is unavailable due to being overloaded or throttled. To ensure graceful degradation, the system automatically switches to a default or more affordable model, maintaining service continuity instead of failing completely.

> 举例：智能体要为分析师处理大体量金融数据——若对方只要「马上看一眼」的初稿，可选用更快、更省的模型速览主趋势；若涉及关键投资决策、预算与时间更充裕，则可加码调用更强、更慢、误差更可控的预测模型。在这一类系统里，回退机制尤为关键：首选模型因过载或限流不可用时，系统自动切到默认或更经济的备选，以优雅降级维持可用性，而不是一崩到底。

## Practical Applications & Use Cases

> ## 实际应用与用例

Practical use cases include:

> 典型落地场景包括：

* **Cost-Optimized LLM Usage:** An agent deciding whether to use a large, expensive LLM for complex tasks or a smaller, more affordable one for simpler queries, based on a budget constraint.  
* **Latency-Sensitive Operations:** In real-time systems, an agent chooses a faster but potentially less comprehensive reasoning path to ensure a timely response.  
* **Energy Efficiency:** For agents deployed on edge devices or with limited power, optimizing their processing to conserve battery life.  
* **Fallback for service reliability:**  An agent automatically switches to a backup model when the primary choice is unavailable, ensuring service continuity and graceful degradation.  
* **Data Usage Management:** An agent opting for summarized data retrieval instead of full dataset downloads to save bandwidth or storage.  
* **Adaptive Task Allocation:** In multi-agent systems, agents self-assign tasks based on their current computational load or available time.

> * **成本敏感的 LLM 选型：** 在预算硬约束下，复杂任务走大模型、轻量问答走小模型。  
> * **延迟优先：** 实时场景可牺牲一定推理深度，换更短的端到端时延。  
> * **能效与续航：** 边缘或电池供电环境下调度算力，尽量拉长可用时间。  
> * **可靠性回退：** 主模型故障或限流时自动切备用模型，保障业务连续与体验平滑降级。  
> * **数据与带宽：** 用摘要或抽样拉数，替代整库搬运，节省带宽与本地存储。  
> * **负载感知的任务分派：** 多智能体按各自当前算力余量与时间片自组织认领子任务。

## Hands-On Code Example

> ## 动手代码示例

An intelligent system for answering user questions can assess the difficulty of each question. For simple queries, it utilizes a cost-effective language model such as Gemini Flash. For complex inquiries, a more powerful, but expensive, language model (like Gemini Pro) is considered. The decision to use the more powerful model also depends on resource availability, specifically budget and time constraints. This system dynamically selects appropriate models.

> 问答系统可先判别请求难度：直白问题交给 Gemini Flash 一类经济型模型；高难推理再考虑 Gemini Pro 等更强、更贵的后端。是否「升舱」还取决于当下预算与时间窗口，由策略层动态拍板。

For example, consider a travel planner built with a hierarchical agent. The high-level planning, which involves understanding a user's complex request, breaking it down into a multi-step itinerary, and making logical decisions, would be managed by a sophisticated and more powerful LLM like Gemini Pro. This is the "planner" agent that requires a deep understanding of context and the ability to reason.

> 以分层旅行助手为例：读懂冗长需求、拆行程、做取舍的高层规划，交给 Gemini Pro 等强模型——也就是承担深度语境理解与链式推理的「规划」智能体。

However, once the plan is established, the individual tasks within that plan, such as looking up flight prices, checking hotel availability, or finding restaurant reviews, are essentially simple, repetitive web queries. These "tool function calls" can be executed by a faster and more affordable model like Gemini Flash. It is easier to visualize why the affordable model can be used for these straightforward web searches, while the intricate planning phase requires the greater intelligence of the more advanced model to ensure a coherent and logical travel plan.

> 行程骨架敲定后，查票价、看空房、搜点评等子步骤多为模板化检索，对应的工具调用可交给 Gemini Flash 等轻量模型。直觉上：机械查询走省模型，统筹规划走强模型，才能在成本与行程质量间取得平衡。

Google's ADK supports this approach through its multi-agent architecture, which allows for modular and scalable applications. Different agents can handle specialized tasks. Model flexibility enables the direct use of various Gemini models, including both Gemini Pro and Gemini Flash, or integration of other models through LiteLLM. The ADK's orchestration capabilities support dynamic, LLM-driven routing for adaptive behavior. Built-in evaluation features allow systematic assessment of agent performance, which can be used for system refinement (see the Chapter on Evaluation and Monitoring).

> Google ADK 的多智能体架构天然契合上述拆分：按职责划分子智能体，系统更易模块化扩展。模型侧既可直连 Gemini Pro/Flash，也可经 LiteLLM 挂接第三方。编排层支持 LLM 驱动的动态路由以随负载与任务形态自适应；配套评估能力可持续度量智能体表现并反哺路由策略（详见评估与监控章节）。

Next, two agents with identical setup but utilizing different models and costs will be defined.

> 下文先定义两台配置一致、仅模型档位与成本曲线不同的智能体。

```python
# Conceptual Python-like structure, not runnable code
from google.adk.agents import Agent
# from google.adk.models.lite_llm import LiteLlm  # If using models not directly supported by ADK's default Agent

# Agent using the more expensive Gemini Pro 2.5
gemini_pro_agent = Agent(
    name="GeminiProAgent",
    model="gemini-2.5-pro",  # Placeholder for actual model name if different
    description="A highly capable agent for complex queries.",
    instruction="You are an expert assistant for complex problem-solving.",
)

# Agent using the less expensive Gemini Flash 2.5
gemini_flash_agent = Agent(
    name="GeminiFlashAgent",
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",  # Placeholder for actual model name if different
    description="A fast and efficient agent for simple queries.",
    instruction="You are a quick assistant for straightforward questions.",
)
```

A Router Agent can direct queries based on simple metrics like query length, where shorter queries go to less expensive models and longer queries to more capable models. However, a more sophisticated Router Agent can utilize either  LLM or ML models to analyze query nuances and complexity. This LLM router can determine which downstream language model is most suitable. For example, a query requesting a factual recall is routed to a flash model, while a complex query requiring deep analysis is routed to a pro model.

> 路由层可先用粗粒度启发式（如词数）分流：短问句走经济模型，长文本走旗舰模型。进阶做法是让独立 LLM 或小模型判别语义复杂度——事实检索类走 Flash，多跳推理类走 Pro。

Optimization techniques can further enhance the LLM router's effectiveness. Prompt tuning involves crafting prompts to guide the router LLM for better routing decisions. Fine-tuning the LLM router on a dataset of queries and their optimal model choices improves its accuracy and efficiency. This dynamic routing capability balances response quality with cost-effectiveness.

> 还可叠加提示工程、监督微调等手段：为路由 LLM 写清决策准则，或用「查询—最优后端」标注数据微调路由器，以提高命中率。动态路由的本质，是在回答质量与账单之间找可操作的最优折中。

```python
# Conceptual Python-like structure, not runnable code
import asyncio
from typing import AsyncGenerator

from google.adk.agents import Agent, BaseAgent
from google.adk.events import Event
from google.adk.agents.invocation_context import InvocationContext


class QueryRouterAgent(BaseAgent):
    name: str = "QueryRouter"
    description: str = "Routes user queries to the appropriate LLM agent based on complexity."

    async def _run_async_impl(self, context: InvocationContext) -> AsyncGenerator[Event, None]:
        user_query = context.current_message.text  # Assuming text input
        query_length = len(user_query.split())  # Simple metric: number of words

        if query_length < 20:  # Example threshold for simplicity vs. complexity
            print(f"Routing to Gemini Flash Agent for short query (length: {query_length})")
            # In a real ADK setup, you would 'transfer_to_agent' or directly invoke
            # For demonstration, we'll simulate a call and yield its response
            response = await gemini_flash_agent.run_async(context.current_message)
            yield Event(author=self.name, content=f"Flash Agent processed: {response}")
        else:
            print(f"Routing to Gemini Pro Agent for long query (length: {query_length})")
            response = await gemini_pro_agent.run_async(context.current_message)
            yield Event(author=self.name, content=f"Pro Agent processed: {response}")
```

The Critique Agent evaluates responses from language models, providing feedback that serves several functions. For self-correction, it identifies errors or inconsistencies, prompting the answering agent to refine its output for improved quality. It also systematically assesses responses for performance monitoring, tracking metrics like accuracy and relevance, which are used for optimization.

> 批评（Critique）智能体负责质检模型输出：一方面做在线纠错——指出事实或逻辑漏洞，驱动回答侧迭代；另一方面沉淀指标——持续跟踪准确率、相关性等，为路由与模型策略提供优化信号。

Additionally, its feedback can signal reinforcement learning or fine-tuning; consistent identification of inadequate Flash model responses, for instance, can refine the router agent's logic. While not directly managing the budget, the Critique Agent contributes to indirect budget management by identifying suboptimal routing choices, such as directing simple queries to a Pro model or complex queries to a Flash model, which leads to poor results. This informs adjustments that improve resource allocation and cost savings.

> 这些信号亦可喂给强化学习或监督微调：若 Flash 屡次在特定题型上失手，可上调该类的路由阈值。Critique 虽不直接「管账」，却能暴露错配——如简单题误送 Pro、难题误送 Flash——从而间接收紧资源浪费。

The Critique Agent can be configured to review either only the generated text from the answering agent or both the original query and the generated text, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of the response's alignment with the initial question.

> 可按需配置：只审模型最终答复，或连同原始提问一并审，以核对是否答所问、是否漏条件。

```python
CRITIC_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are the **Critic Agent**, serving as the quality assurance arm of our collaborative research assistant system. Your primary function is to **meticulously review and challenge** information from the Researcher Agent, guaranteeing **accuracy, completeness, and unbiased presentation**. Your duties encompass: * **Assessing research findings** for factual correctness, thoroughness, and potential leanings. * **Identifying any missing data** or inconsistencies in reasoning. * **Raising critical questions** that could refine or expand the current understanding. * **Offering constructive suggestions** for enhancement or exploring different angles. * **Validating that the final output is comprehensive** and balanced. All criticism must be constructive. Your goal is to fortify the research, not invalidate it. Structure your feedback clearly, drawing attention to specific points for revision. Your overarching aim is to ensure the final research product meets the highest possible quality standards. 
"""
```

The Critic Agent operates based on a predefined system prompt that outlines its role, responsibilities, and feedback approach. A well-designed prompt for this agent must clearly establish its function as an evaluator. It should specify the areas for critical focus and emphasize providing constructive feedback rather than mere dismissal. The prompt should also encourage the identification of both strengths and weaknesses, and it must guide the agent on how to structure and present its feedback.

> Critique 的运行态由系统提示锚定：写清「你是谁、评什么、怎么评」。优质提示会划定检查清单、要求证据式批评而非空泛否定，并规定输出结构，便于下游自动消化。

## Hands-On Code with OpenAI

> ## OpenAI 动手代码

This system uses a resource-aware optimization strategy to handle user queries efficiently. It first classifies each query into one of three categories to determine the most appropriate and cost-effective processing pathway. This approach avoids wasting computational resources on simple requests while ensuring complex queries get the necessary attention. The three categories are:

> 该示例用资源感知路由处理用户查询：先把请求分成三类，再映射到最省算力又够用的处理链——轻问句不滥用大模型，重推理与强时效需求则单独加码。三类定义如下：

* simple: For straightforward questions that can be answered directly without complex reasoning or external data.  
* reasoning: For queries that require logical deduction or multi-step thought processes, which are routed to more powerful models.  
* `internetsearch`: For questions needing current information, which automatically triggers a Google Search to provide an up-to-date answer.

> * simple：事实清晰、无需链式推理或外源数据的直球问题。  
> * reasoning：依赖逻辑、演算或多步推断的请求，交给更强模型。  
> * `internetsearch`：强依赖当下事实或训练集未覆盖的信息，自动走 Google 搜索再综合作答。

This Python code implements a prompt routing system to answer user questions. It begins by loading necessary API keys from a .env file for OpenAI and Google Custom Search. The core functionality lies in classifying the user's prompt into three categories: simple, reasoning, or internet search. A dedicated function utilizes an OpenAI model for this classification step. If the prompt requires current information, a Google search is performed using the Google Custom Search API. Another function then generates the final response, selecting an appropriate OpenAI model based on the classification. For internet search queries, the search results are provided as context to the model. The main `handleprompt` function orchestrates this workflow, calling the classification and search (if needed) functions before generating the response. It returns the classification, the model used, and the generated answer. This system efficiently directs different types of queries to optimized methods for a better response.

> 这段 Python 以提示路由驱动问答：`.env` 中读取 OpenAI 与 Google 自定义搜索密钥；`classify_prompt` 借助 OpenAI 将输入打上 simple / reasoning / internet_search 标签；命中搜索类则先拉取检索结果，再连同用户问题喂给对应档位的补全模型。入口函数 `handle_prompt`（正文一处误作 handleprompt）串联分类、可选搜索与生成，最终返回标签、实际调用模型与答案，实现按题型分摊算力。

# Hands-On Code Example (OpenRouter)

OpenRouter offers a unified interface to hundreds of AI models via a single API endpoint. It provides automated failover and cost-optimization, with easy integration through your preferred SDK or framework.

> OpenRouter 以单一 HTTPS 端点聚合数百个模型路由，内置故障转移与成本导向的选型能力，亦可嵌入常见 SDK 与编排框架。

```python
import json
import requests

response = requests.post(
    url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>",
        "HTTP-Referer": "<YOUR_SITE_URL>",  # Optional. Site URL for rankings on openrouter.ai.
        "X-Title": "<YOUR_SITE_NAME>",      # Optional. Site title for rankings on openrouter.ai.
    },
    data=json.dumps({
        "model": "openai/gpt-4o",  # Optional
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "What is the meaning of life?"
            }
        ]
    }),
)
```

This code snippet uses the requests library to interact with the OpenRouter API. It sends a POST request to the chat completion endpoint with a user message. The request includes authorization headers with an API key and optional site information. The goal is to get a response from a specified language model, in this case, "openai/gpt-4o".

> 示例用 `requests` 直连接口：向 `/chat/completions` 发送 POST，附用户消息、Bearer Token 及可选站点元数据，即可指定 `openai/gpt-4o` 等模型完成补全。

Openrouter offers two distinct methodologies for routing and determining the computational model used to process a given request.

> OpenRouter 在「谁来跑推理」这一层提供两条主路径。

* **Automated Model Selection:** This function routes a request to an optimized model chosen from a curated set of available models. The selection is predicated on the specific content of the user's prompt. The identifier of the model that ultimately processes the request is returned in the response's metadata.

> * **自动模型选择：** 依据提示语义在候选池里挑选「当前最优」后端；真正落算的模型 ID 会在响应元信息中回显。

```json
{  
    "model": "openrouter/auto",  
    ... // Other params 
}
```

* **Sequential Model Fallback:** This mechanism provides operational redundancy by allowing users to specify a hierarchical list of models. The system will first attempt to process the request with the primary model designated in the sequence. Should this primary model fail to respond due to any number of error conditions—such as service unavailability, rate-limiting, or content filtering—the system will automatically re-route the request to the next specified model in the sequence. This process continues until a model in the list successfully executes the request or the list is exhausted. The final cost of the operation and the model identifier returned in the response will correspond to the model that successfully completed the computation.

> * **顺序回退列表：** 显式给出优先级数组，请求先在首选模型上执行；遇宕机、429、内容策略拦截等错误时自动降级到下一候选，直到命中或耗尽；账单与 `model` 字段以最终成功的那个为准。

```json
{  
    "models": ["anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet", "gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b"],  
    ... // Other params }
```

## Beyond Dynamic Model Switching: A Spectrum of Agent Resource Optimizations

> ## 超越动态换模：智能体资源优化谱系

Resource-aware optimization is paramount in developing intelligent agent systems that operate efficiently and effectively within real-world constraints. Let's see a number of additional techniques:

> 要让智能体在真实世界的预算、时延与能耗边界内稳定服役，资源感知优化几乎贯穿全栈。除动态换模外，还可组合以下手段：

**Dynamic Model Switching** is a critical technique involving the strategic selection of large language models  based on the intricacies of the task at hand and the available computational resources. When faced with simple queries, a lightweight, cost-effective LLM can be deployed, whereas complex, multifaceted problems necessitate the utilization of more sophisticated and resource-intensive models.

> **动态模型切换：** 按任务难度与当下算力余量切换后端；「快问快答」走轻量模型，「深水区」再唤醒旗舰模型。

**Adaptive Tool Use & Selection** ensures agents can intelligently choose from a suite of tools, selecting the most appropriate and efficient one for each specific sub-task, with careful consideration given to factors like API usage costs, latency, and execution time. This dynamic tool selection enhances overall system efficiency by optimizing the use of external APIs and services.

> **自适应工具选择与调用：** 在工具箱里为每个子问题挑「性价比最高」的外挂，综合单价、时延与失败率，避免为小事开大车。

**Contextual Pruning & Summarization** plays a vital role in managing the amount of information processed by agents, strategically minimizing the prompt token count and reducing inference costs by intelligently summarizing and selectively retaining only the most relevant information from the interaction history, preventing unnecessary computational overhead.

> **上下文剪枝与摘要：** 对历史对话做滚动摘要或相关性过滤，控制 prompt 体积与 KV 缓存占用，把 token 花在刀刃上。

**Proactive Resource Prediction** involves anticipating resource demands by forecasting future workloads and system requirements, which allows for proactive allocation and management of resources, ensuring system responsiveness and preventing bottlenecks.

> **主动容量预测：** 结合排队长度、季节性流量等信号预估峰值，提前扩容或预热模型，降低尾延迟。

**Cost-Sensitive Exploration** in multi-agent systems extends optimization considerations to encompass communication costs alongside traditional computational costs, influencing the strategies employed by agents to collaborate and share information, aiming to minimize the overall resource expenditure.

> **多智能体下的成本敏感协同：** 把跨节点消息、向量检索等传统「隐形开销」纳入目标函数，调整通信拓扑与信息共享粒度。

**What:** Resource-Aware Optimization addresses the challenge of managing the consumption of computational, temporal, and financial resources in intelligent systems. LLM-based applications can be expensive and slow, and selecting the best model or tool for every task is often inefficient. This creates a fundamental trade-off between the quality of a system's output and the resources required to produce it. Without a dynamic management strategy, systems cannot adapt to varying task complexities or operate within budgetary and performance constraints.

> **是什么：** 资源感知优化回答「在算力、时钟与账单三重约束下，智能体该如何干活」。LLM 应用天然贵且慢，若凡事上顶配模型，质量边际收益会迅速递减；缺乏动态治理，则既难贴合任务难度，也难守住 SLA 与预算红线。

**Why:** The standardized solution is to build an agentic system that intelligently monitors and allocates resources based on the task at hand. This pattern typically employs a "Router Agent" to first classify the complexity of an incoming request. The request is then forwarded to the most suitable LLM or tool—a fast, inexpensive model for simple queries, and a more powerful one for complex reasoning. A "Critique Agent" can further refine the process by evaluating the quality of the response, providing feedback to improve the routing logic over time. This dynamic, multi-agent approach ensures the system operates efficiently, balancing response quality with cost-effectiveness.

> **为什么：** 工程上可收敛为「感知—决策—反馈」闭环：路由智能体先判别请求硬度，再把流量导向匹配的模型或工具链；Critique 智能体持续抽检答案质量，把错配案例回灌给路由策略。多角色分工让系统在质量、时延与费用之间可运营、可迭代。

**Rule of Thumb:** Use this pattern when operating under strict financial budgets for API calls or computational power, building latency-sensitive applications where quick response times are critical, deploying agents on resource-constrained hardware such as edge devices with limited battery life, programmatically balancing the trade-off between response quality and operational cost, and managing complex, multi-step workflows where different tasks have varying resource requirements.

> **经验法则：** 只要同时在意「答得好不好」与「花多少钱、等多久」——例如 API 配额吃紧、实时交互、边缘续航、或一条流水线里各步骤算力需求悬殊——就应显式引入资源感知优化，而不是默认全局同一档模型。
