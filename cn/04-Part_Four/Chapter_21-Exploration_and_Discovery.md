# Chapter 21: Exploration and Discovery

> 第二十一章：探索与发现（Exploration and Discovery）

This chapter explores patterns that enable intelligent agents to actively seek out novel information, uncover new possibilities, and identify unknown unknowns within their operational environment. Exploration and discovery differ from reactive behaviors or optimization within a predefined solution space. Instead, they focus on agents proactively venturing into unfamiliar territories, experimenting with new approaches, and generating new knowledge or understanding. This pattern is crucial for agents operating in open-ended, complex, or rapidly evolving domains where static knowledge or pre-programmed solutions are insufficient. It emphasizes the agent's capacity to expand its understanding and capabilities.

> 本章关注一类模式：驱动智能体主动搜寻新信息、打开新可能，并在运行环境里识别「未知的未知」。它与仅在既定解空间里被动响应或做局部优化不同——核心在于智能体愿意踏入陌生地带、试错新方法、沉淀新知。在开放、复杂或快速演化的领域，静态知识库与硬编码流程往往不够用；此时，能否持续扩张认知边界，决定代理的上限。

## Practical Applications & Use Cases

> ## 实际应用场景与用例

AI agents possess the ability to intelligently prioritize and explore, which leads to applications across various domains. By autonomously evaluating and ordering potential actions, these agents can navigate complex environments, uncover hidden insights, and drive innovation. This capacity for prioritized exploration enables them to optimize processes, discover new knowledge, and generate content.

> 当代 AI 智能体已能把「先探哪条路」与「怎么探」结合起来：先对候选行动做优先级评估，再按序深入复杂环境，挖掘隐藏关联并催化创新。带优先级的探索让它们既能优化流程，也能产出新知识与新内容。

Google Co-Scientist

> Google Co-Scientist（AI 协作科学家）

An AI co-scientist is an AI system developed by Google Research designed as a computational scientific collaborator. It assists human scientists in research aspects such as hypothesis generation, proposal refinement, and experimental design. This system operates on the Gemini LLM..

> AI co-scientist 由 Google Research 推出，定位是「计算科学协作体」：在真实科研流程里辅助假设提出、课题论证与实验设计；底层由 Gemini 系列大模型驱动。

The development of the AI co-scientist addresses challenges in scientific research. These include processing large volumes of information, generating testable hypotheses, and managing experimental planning. The AI co-scientist supports researchers by performing tasks that involve large-scale information processing and synthesis, potentially revealing relationships within data. Its purpose is to augment human cognitive processes by handling computationally demanding aspects of early-stage research.

> 它瞄准科研痛点：文献爆炸、可验证假设难提、实验排期复杂等。系统擅长吞吐与综合海量信息，帮助研究者看见跨文献的潜在关联；把算力密集的探索阶段交给模型，人类则专注直觉与判断。

**System Architecture and Methodology:** The architecture of the AI co-scientist is based on a multi-agent framework, structured to emulate collaborative and iterative processes. This design integrates specialized AI agents, each with a specific role in contributing to a research objective. A supervisor agent manages and coordinates the activities of these individual agents within an asynchronous task execution framework that allows for flexible scaling of computational resources.

> **系统架构与方法：** 整体采用多智能体拓扑，流程上模拟实验室里的分工协作。若干专科代理围绕同一科研问题各施所长；监督代理在异步调度层统一编排，并可弹性扩容算力以匹配任务规模。

The core agents and their functions include (see Fig. 1):

> 核心代理与职责划分如下（见图 1）：

* **Generation agent**: Initiates the process by producing initial hypotheses through literature exploration and simulated scientific debates.  
* **Reflection agent**: Acts as a peer reviewer, critically assessing the correctness, novelty, and quality of the generated hypotheses.  
* **Ranking agent**: Employs an Elo-based tournament to compare, rank, and prioritize hypotheses through simulated scientific debates.  
* **Evolution agent**: Continuously refines top-ranked hypotheses by simplifying concepts, synthesizing ideas, and exploring unconventional reasoning.  
* **Proximity agent**: Computes a proximity graph to cluster similar ideas and assist in exploring the hypothesis landscape.  
* **Meta-review agent**: Synthesizes insights from all reviews and debates to identify common patterns and provide feedback, enabling the system to continuously improve.

> * **生成智能体（Generation agent）：** 结合文献检索与「虚拟学术辩论」抛出首批假设，拉开探索序幕。  
> * **反思智能体（Reflection agent）：** 以审稿人视角审视假设的科学性、原创度与表述质量。  
> * **排序智能体（Ranking agent）：** 借助 Elo 式对抗赛在多轮辩论中比较假设强弱并完成排序。  
> * **演化智能体（Evolution agent）：** 对头部假设做概念压缩、思想融合与非常规推理，迭代升级版本。  
> * **邻近智能体（Proximity agent）：** 构建相似度图，聚类相近想法，帮助研究者在高维假设空间里导航。  
> * **元评审智能体（Meta-review agent）：** 汇总各轮评审与辩论，提炼共性模式与改进信号，驱动下一轮自我进化。

The system's operational foundation relies on Gemini, which provides language understanding, reasoning, and generative abilities. The system incorporates "test-time compute scaling," a mechanism that allocates increased computational resources to iteratively reason and enhance outputs. The system processes and synthesizes information from diverse sources, including academic literature, web-based data, and databases.

> 语言理解、链式推理与内容生成均由 Gemini 支撑；同时引入「测试时算力扩展（test-time compute scaling）」，在需要多轮推敲答案时临时加大推理预算。知识侧则融合论文、开放网络与结构化数据库等多源证据。

Fig. 1: (Courtesy of the Authors) AI Co-Scientist: Ideation to Validation

> 图 1：（作者供图）AI Co-Scientist：从创意到验证

The system follows an iterative "generate, debate, and evolve" approach mirroring the scientific method. Following the input of a scientific problem from a human scientist, the system engages in a self-improving cycle of hypothesis generation, evaluation, and refinement. Hypotheses undergo systematic assessment, including internal evaluations among agents and a tournament-based ranking mechanism.

> 工作流与经典科研节奏同构：「生成 → 辩论 → 演化」。科学家抛出课题后，系统进入自我改进闭环：持续产出假设、互评打分、再精炼；内部既有多代理互审，也有锦标赛式排序作为质量闸门。

**Validation and Results:** The AI co-scientist's utility has been demonstrated in several validation studies, particularly in biomedicine, assessing its performance through automated benchmarks, expert reviews, and end-to-end wet-lab experiments.

> **验证与结果：** 论文与配套实验表明该系统在生物医学等方向确有落地价值，评估手段覆盖自动基准、领域专家打分以及完整湿实验链路。

**Automated and Expert Evaluation:** On the challenging GPQA benchmark, the system's internal Elo rating was shown to be concordant with the accuracy of its results, achieving a top-1 accuracy of 78.4% on the difficult "diamond set". Analysis across over 200 research goals demonstrated that scaling test-time compute consistently improves the quality of hypotheses, as measured by the Elo rating. On a curated set of 15 challenging problems, the AI co-scientist outperformed other state-of-the-art AI models and the "best guess" solutions provided by human experts. In a small-scale evaluation, biomedical experts rated the co-scientist's outputs as more novel and impactful compared to other baseline models. The system's proposals for drug repurposing, formatted as NIH Specific Aims pages, were also judged to be of high quality by a panel of six expert oncologists.

> **自动化与专家评估：** 在 GPQA 高难度子集上，内部 Elo 分数与真实准确率高度一致，「diamond set」top-1 达 78.4%。对 200 多个研究目标的统计还显示：追加测试时算力可单调提升假设质量（仍以 Elo 量化）。在 15 道精选难题上，系统整体优于同期 SOTA 模型以及人类专家的「最佳猜测」。小规模盲评中，生物医学同行认为其提案比基线模型更新颖、更有潜在影响力；六名肿瘤专家亦对 NIH Specific Aims 风格的药物重定位草案给出高分。

**End-to-End Experimental Validation:**

> **端到端实验验证：**

Drug Repurposing: For acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the system proposed novel drug candidates. Some of these, like KIRA6, were completely novel suggestions with no prior preclinical evidence for use in AML. Subsequent in vitro experiments confirmed that KIRA6 and other suggested drugs inhibited tumor cell viability at clinically relevant concentrations in multiple AML cell lines.

> **药物重定位：** 面向急性髓系白血病（AML），模型给出多条候选分子；像 KIRA6 这类建议在公开 AML 临床前文献中几乎找不到先例。随后的体外实验显示，KIRA6 等同批推荐在临床相关浓度下，可显著抑制多种 AML 细胞系活力。

 Novel Target Discovery: The system identified novel epigenetic targets for liver fibrosis. Laboratory experiments using human hepatic organoids validated these findings, showing that drugs targeting the suggested epigenetic modifiers had significant anti-fibrotic activity. One of the identified drugs is already FDA-approved for another condition, opening an opportunity for repurposing.

> **新靶点发现：** 在肝纤维化场景下，系统指向一组新的表观遗传调控因子。人源肝类器官实验复现了预测：靶向这些因子的化合物展现明确抗纤维化效应，其中一款已是 FDA 批准的老药，为重定位提供捷径。

Antimicrobial Resistance: The AI co-scientist independently recapitulated unpublished experimental findings. It was tasked to explain why certain mobile genetic elements (cf-PICIs) are found across many bacterial species. In two days, the system's top-ranked hypothesis was that cf-PICIs interact with diverse phage tails to expand their host range. This mirrored the novel, experimentally validated discovery that an independent research group had reached after more than a decade of research.

> **抗菌耐药性：** 在独立任务中，系统两天内给出的首选假设，与某团队尚未发表、历时十余年方获实验验证的结论一致：可移动遗传元件 cf-PICIs 可能通过结合多种噬菌体尾部蛋白来拓宽宿主谱。换言之，模型在无先验内幕的情况下「撞」上了真实世界的新知。

**Augmentation, and Limitations:** The design philosophy behind the AI co-scientist emphasizes augmentation rather than complete automation of human research. Researchers interact with and guide the system through natural language, providing feedback, contributing their own ideas, and directing the AI's exploratory processes in a "scientist-in-the-loop" collaborative paradigm. However, the system has some limitations. Its knowledge is constrained by its reliance on open-access literature, potentially missing critical prior work behind paywalls. It also has limited access to negative experimental results, which are rarely published but crucial for experienced scientists. Furthermore, the system inherits limitations from the underlying LLMs, including the potential for factual inaccuracies or "hallucinations".

> **增强与局限：** 产品哲学是**人机共研**，而非一键替代科学家。用户可用自然语言投喂洞见、纠偏方向，在 scientist-in-the-loop 框架里共同驾驭探索。局限同样现实：训练语料以开放获取文献为主，付费墙背后的关键论文可能缺席；阴性结果本就稀缺，模型更难学到「此路不通」的经验；最后仍受 LLM 固有幻觉与事实漂移约束。

**Safety:** Safety is a critical consideration, and the system incorporates multiple safeguards. All research goals are reviewed for safety upon input, and generated hypotheses are also checked to prevent the system from being used for unsafe or unethical research. A preliminary safety evaluation using 1,200 adversarial research goals found that the system could robustly reject dangerous inputs. To ensure responsible development, the system is being made available to more scientists through a Trusted Tester Program to gather real-world feedback.

> **安全：** 安全被嵌入默认路径：研究问题入库前即做政策扫描，生成假设亦经二次过滤，避免被滥用于危险实验。对抗性测试集（约 1200 条恶意目标）显示拒绝策略总体稳健。团队亦通过 Trusted Tester Program 逐步扩大试用面，收集真实滥用场景反馈以迭代护栏。

## Hands-On Code Example

> ## 动手代码示例

Let's look at a concrete example of agentic AI for Exploration and Discovery in action: Agent Laboratory, a project developed by Samuel Schmidgall under the MIT License.

> 接下来用 **Agent Laboratory**（Samuel Schmidgall，MIT 许可）展示探索型智能体如何落地。

"Agent Laboratory" is an autonomous research workflow framework designed to augment human scientific endeavors rather than replace them. This system leverages specialized LLMs to automate various stages of the scientific research process, thereby enabling human researchers to dedicate more cognitive resources to conceptualization and critical analysis.

> Agent Laboratory 是一套自主科研工作流编排器：目标是把机械环节交给专职 LLM，人类则把脑力留给问题建模与批判性反思，而非简单替代研究员。

The framework integrates "AgentRxiv," a decentralized repository for autonomous research agents. AgentRxiv facilitates the deposition, retrieval, and development of research outputs

> 框架内置 **AgentRxiv**，一个面向自治科研代理的去中心化知识库，支持论文级产物的发布、拉取与协同迭代。

Agent Laboratory guides the research process through distinct phases:

> 典型流水线被拆成四个阶段：

1. **Literature Review:** During this initial phase, specialized LLM-driven agents are tasked with the autonomous collection and critical analysis of pertinent scholarly literature. This involves leveraging external databases such as arXiv to identify, synthesize, and categorize relevant research, effectively establishing a comprehensive knowledge base for the subsequent stages.  
2. **Experimentation:** This phase encompasses the collaborative formulation of experimental designs, data preparation, execution of experiments, and analysis of results. Agents utilize integrated tools like Python for code generation and execution, and Hugging Face for model access, to conduct automated experimentation. The system is designed for iterative refinement, where agents can adapt and optimize experimental procedures based on real-time outcomes.  
3. **Report Writing:** In the final phase, the system automates the generation of comprehensive research reports. This involves synthesizing findings from the experimentation phase with insights from the literature review, structuring the document according to academic conventions, and integrating external tools like LaTeX for professional formatting and figure generation.  
4. **Knowledge Sharing**: AgentRxiv is a platform enabling autonomous research agents to share, access, and collaboratively advance scientific discoveries. It allows agents to build upon previous findings, fostering cumulative research progress.

> 1. **文献综述：** 专科代理自动抓取并批判性阅读相关论文，依托 arXiv 等索引构建可检索知识底座。  
> 2. **实验：** 多代理协同撰写实验方案、清洗数据、跑通实验并解读指标；Python 负责代码合成与执行，Hugging Face 提供模型侧能力，全程支持基于中间结果的滚动优化。  
> 3. **报告撰写：** 将实验洞见与文献证据融合，按学术体例排版，并可挂接 LaTeX 生成正式稿件与插图。  
> 4. **知识共享：** 通过 AgentRxiv 让不同代理彼此复用、增量改进历史成果，形成开放式累积创新。

The modular architecture of Agent Laboratory ensures computational flexibility. The aim is to enhance research productivity by automating tasks while maintaining the human researcher.

> 模块化拆分带来算力与工具链的弹性；设计原则是「人掌舵、机跑腿」，用自动化换吞吐，而不是稀释人类判断。

**Code analysis:** While a comprehensive code analysis is beyond the scope of this book, I want to provide you with some key insights and encourage you to delve into the code on your own.

> **代码分析：** 篇幅所限无法逐行剖代码，这里只列关键设计抓手，细节请读者克隆仓库自行跟踪。

**Judgment:** In order to emulate human evaluative processes, the system employs a tripartite agentic judgment mechanism for assessing outputs. This involves the deployment of three distinct autonomous agents, each configured to evaluate the production from a specific perspective, thereby collectively mimicking the nuanced and multi-faceted nature of human judgment. This approach allows for a more robust and comprehensive appraisal, moving beyond singular metrics to capture a richer qualitative assessment.

> **评判机制：** 为逼近人类审稿体验，系统实现**三评审联评**：三名自治代理分别强调实验扎实度、领域影响力与创意新颖度，多维打分后再汇总；相比单一 scalar reward，更能捕获质性差异。

        else:
            self.notes = notes
        self.model = model
        self.openai_api_key = openai_api_key

        )

        reviewer_2 = "You are a harsh and critical but fair reviewer who is looking for an idea that would be impactful in the field."
        review_2 = get_score(
            outlined_plan=plan,
            latex=report,
            reward_model_llm=self.model,
            reviewer_type=reviewer_2,
            openai_api_key=self.openai_api_key
        )

        reviewer_3 = "You are a harsh but fair open-minded reviewer that is looking for novel ideas that have not been proposed before."
        review_3 = get_score(
            outlined_plan=plan,
            latex=report,
            reward_model_llm=self.model,
            reviewer_type=reviewer_3,
            openai_api_key=self.openai_api_key
        )

        return f"Reviewer #1:\n{review_1}, \nReviewer #2:\n{review_2}, \nReviewer #3:\n{review_3}"
```

The judgment agents are designed with a specific prompt that closely emulates the cognitive framework and evaluation criteria typically employed by human reviewers. This prompt guides the agents to analyze outputs through a lens similar to how a human expert would, considering factors like relevance, coherence, factual accuracy, and overall quality. By crafting these prompts to mirror human review protocols, the system aims to achieve a level of evaluative sophistication that approaches human-like discernment.

## At a Glance

> ## 要点速览

**What:** AI agents often operate within predefined knowledge, limiting their ability to tackle novel situations or open-ended problems. In complex and dynamic environments, this static, pre-programmed information is insufficient for true innovation or discovery. The fundamental challenge is to enable agents to move beyond simple optimization to actively seek out new information and identify "unknown unknowns." This necessitates a paradigm shift from purely reactive behaviors to proactive, Agentic exploration that expands the system's own understanding and capabilities.

> **是什么：** 许多代理仍被锁在预训练或手工整理的知识边界里，遇到开放题就容易「只会背答案」。复杂世界里，静态 playbook 撑不起真创新。关键跃迁是从「在已知目标函数上微调」转向「主动扩张状态空间」，显式寻找未知未知。

**Why:** The standardized solution is to build Agentic AI systems specifically designed for autonomous exploration and discovery. These systems often utilize a multi-agent framework where specialized LLMs collaborate to emulate processes like the scientific method. For instance, distinct agents can be tasked with generating hypotheses, critically reviewing them, and evolving the most promising concepts. This structured, collaborative methodology allows the system to intelligently navigate vast information landscapes, design and execute experiments, and generate genuinely new knowledge. By automating the labor-intensive aspects of exploration, these systems augment human intellect and significantly accelerate the pace of discovery.

> **为什么：** 工程上通常落地为「探索专用」的多智能体栈：不同模型分别承担提出假设、互怼审稿、筛选进化等职能，整体对齐科学方法的闭环。这样系统才能在浩渺文献与实验空间里智能导航，把人力从重复试错中解放出来，加速从问题到洞见的转化。

**Rule of Thumb:** Use the Exploration and Discovery pattern when operating in open-ended, complex, or rapidly evolving domains where the solution space is not fully defined. It is ideal for tasks requiring the generation of novel hypotheses, strategies, or insights, such as in scientific research, market analysis, and creative content generation. This pattern is essential when the objective is to uncover "unknown unknowns" rather than merely optimizing a known process.

> **经验法则：** 只要问题域开放、演化快、解空间尚未被形式化，就应启用探索与发现模式。科研、市场洞察、创意生产等需要持续提出新假设/新策略的场景最为典型；若 KPI 是「找到从未想过的风险或机会」，而非把旧流程再抠 1% 效率，本模式几乎不可或缺。

## Conclusion

> ## 结论

In conclusion, the Exploration and Discovery pattern is the very essence of a truly agentic system, defining its ability to move beyond passive instruction-following to proactively explore its environment. This innate agentic drive is what empowers an AI to operate autonomously in complex domains, not merely executing tasks but independently setting sub-goals to uncover novel information. This advanced agentic behavior is most powerfully realized through multi-agent frameworks where each agent embodies a specific, proactive role in a larger collaborative process. For instance, the highly agentic system of Google's Co-scientist features agents that autonomously generate, debate, and evolve scientific hypotheses.

> 归根结底，探索与发现刻画了「代理之所以为代理」：不止执行，还会自发拆分子目标去翻石头、找惊喜。复杂课题里，单模型往往不够，需要多代理各司其职、彼此博弈，才能逼近真实科研班的创造力——Google Co-Scientist 即为一例。

Frameworks like Agent Laboratory further structure this by creating an agentic hierarchy that mimics human research teams, enabling the system to self-manage the entire discovery lifecycle. The core of this pattern lies in orchestrating emergent agentic behaviors, allowing the system to pursue long-term, open-ended goals with minimal human intervention. This elevates the human-AI partnership, positioning the AI as a genuine agentic collaborator that handles the autonomous execution of exploratory tasks. By delegating this proactive discovery work to an agentic system, human intellect is significantly augmented, accelerating innovation. The development of such powerful agentic capabilities also necessitates a strong commitment to safety and ethical oversight. Ultimately, this pattern provides the blueprint for creating truly agentic AI, transforming computational tools into independent, goal-seeking partners in the pursuit of knowledge.

> Agent Laboratory 进一步用「导师—执行—评审」式层级把流程产品化，让发现链路可以半自治运转：关键在编排多代理的涌现行为，使系统在弱监督下仍能追逐长期开放目标。人机关系随之升级——AI 不再是被动工具，而是能自己开题、试错、汇总的合作者。当然，能力越强，安全与伦理护栏越要同步加厚；只有把探索关在可控边界内，才能把算力真正转化为可靠的新知生产引擎。
