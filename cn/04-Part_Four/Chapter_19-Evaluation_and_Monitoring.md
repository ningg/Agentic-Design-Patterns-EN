# Chapter 19: Evaluation and Monitoring

> 第十九章：评估与监控（Evaluation and Monitoring）

This chapter examines methodologies that allow intelligent agents to systematically assess their performance, monitor progress toward goals, and detect operational anomalies. While Chapter 11 outlines goal setting and monitoring, and Chapter 17 addresses Reasoning mechanisms, this chapter focuses on the continuous, often external, measurement of an agent's effectiveness, efficiency, and compliance with requirements. This includes defining metrics, establishing feedback loops, and implementing reporting systems to ensure agent performance aligns with expectations in operational environments (see Fig.1)

> 本章讨论如何使智能体系统性地评估自身表现、监控目标进展并发现运行异常。第十一章阐述目标设定与监控，第十七章讨论推理机制；本章则侧重对智能体有效性、效率及合规情况的持续性、以外部观测为主的度量，涵盖指标定义、反馈回路与报告机制，使智能体在运营环境中的表现与期望对齐（见图 1）。

## Practical Applications & Use Cases

> ## 实际应用场景与用例

Most Common Applications and Use Cases:

> 最常见的应用场景包括：

* **Performance Tracking in Live Systems:** Continuously monitoring the accuracy, latency, and resource consumption of an agent deployed in a production environment (e.g., a customer service chatbot's resolution rate, response time).  
* **A/B Testing for Agent Improvements:** Systematically comparing the performance of different agent versions or strategies in parallel to identify optimal approaches (e.g., trying two different planning algorithms for a logistics agent).  
* **Compliance and Safety Audits:** Generate automated audit reports that track an agent's compliance with ethical guidelines, regulatory requirements, and safety protocols over time. These reports can be verified by a human-in-the-loop or another agent, and can generate KPIs or trigger alerts upon identifying issues.  
* **Enterprise systems:** To govern Agentic AI in corporate systems, a new control instrument, the AI "Contract," is needed. This dynamic agreement codifies the objectives, rules, and controls for AI-delegated tasks.  
* **Drift Detection:** Monitoring the relevance or accuracy of an agent's outputs over time, detecting when its performance degrades due to changes in input data distribution (concept drift) or environmental shifts.  
* **Anomaly Detection in Agent Behavior:** Identifying unusual or unexpected actions taken by an agent that might indicate an error, a malicious attack, or an emergent un-desired behavior.  
* **Learning Progress Assessment:** For agents designed to learn, tracking their learning curve, improvement in specific skills, or generalization capabilities over different tasks or data sets.

> * **线上系统性能跟踪：** 持续观测生产环境中智能体的准确率、时延与资源占用（例如客服场景的解决率、响应时间）。  
> * **智能体改进的 A/B 测试：** 并行对比不同版本或策略的效果，筛选更优方案（如对物流智能体并行试用两种规划算法）。  
> * **合规与安全审计：** 自动生成审计报告，长期追踪智能体对伦理准则、法规与安全规程的遵守情况；报告可由人类或其他智能体复核，并在异常时产出 KPI 或触发告警。  
> * **企业系统：** 治理企业级智能体 AI 需要新的抓手——AI「合约（Contract）」；以动态协议把委派任务的目标、规则与控制措施书面化、可执行化。  
> * **漂移检测：** 跟踪智能体输出随时间的相关性或准确度，识别输入分布变化（概念漂移）或环境变迁带来的性能衰减。  
> * **智能体行为异常检测：** 识别反常或出乎意料的行动，可能预示错误、恶意攻击或涌现的不良行为。  
> * **学习进度评估：** 针对具备学习能力的智能体，记录学习曲线、专项技能进步，以及在跨任务、跨数据集上的泛化表现。

## Hands-On Code Example

Developing a comprehensive evaluation framework for AI agents is a challenging endeavor, comparable to an academic discipline or a substantial publication in its complexity. This difficulty stems from the multitude of factors to consider, such as model performance, user interaction, ethical implications, and broader societal impact. Nevertheless, for practical implementation, the focus can be narrowed to critical use cases essential for the efficient and effective functioning of AI agents.

> 为 AI 智能体搭建完备的评估框架难度很大，复杂程度不亚于一门独立学科或一部重量级专著；难点在于需同时权衡模型表现、用户交互、伦理影响与社会影响等维度。落地实践中，可将范围收窄到对智能体高效、可靠运行真正关键的核心用例。

**Agent Response Assessment:** This core process is essential for evaluating the quality and accuracy of an agent's outputs. It involves determining if the agent delivers pertinent, correct,  logical, unbiased, and accurate information in response to given inputs. Assessment metrics may include factual correctness, fluency, grammatical precision, and adherence to the user's intended purpose.

> **智能体回复评估：** 这是评估输出质量与准确性的核心环节，需判断针对给定输入的回复是否相关、正确、逻辑自洽、无偏见且信息可靠；常用指标包括事实正确性、流畅度、语法规范及与用户意图的契合度。

```python
def evaluate_response_accuracy(agent_output: str, expected_output: str) -> float:
    """Calculates a simple accuracy score for agent responses."""
    # This is a very basic exact match; real-world would use more sophisticated metrics
    return 1.0 if agent_output.strip().lower() == expected_output.strip().lower() else 0.0


# Example usage
agent_response = "The capital of France is Paris."
ground_truth = "Paris is the capital of France."
score = evaluate_response_accuracy(agent_response, ground_truth)
print(f"Response accuracy: {score}")
```

The Python function `evaluate_response_accuracy` calculates a basic accuracy score for an AI agent's response by performing an exact, case-insensitive comparison between the agent's output and the expected output, after removing leading or trailing whitespace. It returns a score of 1.0 for an exact match and 0.0 otherwise, representing a binary correct or incorrect evaluation. This method, while straightforward for simple checks, does not account for variations like paraphrasing or semantic equivalence.

> Python 函数 `evaluate_response_accuracy` 在去除首尾空白后，对智能体输出与期望输出进行不区分大小写的逐字精确匹配，得到基础准确率：完全一致为 1.0，否则为 0.0，即二元对错判定。该方法实现简单，但无法处理同义改写或语义等价等情况。

The problem lies in its method of comparison. The function performs a strict, character-for-character comparison of the two strings. In the example provided:

* `agent_response`: "The capital of France is Paris."  
* `ground_truth`: "Paris is the capital of France."

Even after removing whitespace and converting to lowercase, these two strings are not identical. As a result, the function will incorrectly return an accuracy score of `0.0`, even though both sentences convey the same meaning.

> 症结在于比较策略：实现采用严格逐字比对。示例中：  
> * `agent_response`：「The capital of France is Paris.」  
> * `ground_truth`：「Paris is the capital of France.」  
> 即便去掉空白并统一小写，两串仍不一致，函数会误报 `0.0`，而两句语义其实相同。

A straightforward comparison falls short in assessing semantic similarity, only succeeding if an agent's response exactly matches the expected output. A more effective evaluation necessitates advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to discern the meaning between sentences. For thorough AI agent evaluation in real-world scenarios, more sophisticated metrics are often indispensable. These metrics can encompass String Similarity Measures like Levenshtein distance and Jaccard similarity, Keyword Analysis for the presence or absence of specific keywords, Semantic Similarity using cosine similarity with embedding models, LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluations (discussed later for assessing nuanced correctness and helpfulness), and RAG-specific Metrics such as faithfulness and relevance.

> 纯字符串比对难以刻画语义相似，只有与期望输出逐字相同才算「成功」。更有效的评估需借助自然语言处理（NLP）区分句义。真实场景中的智能体评估通常还要组合多种指标，例如 Levenshtein、Jaccard 等字符串相似度，关键词覆盖分析，基于向量嵌入的余弦语义相似度，LLM-as-a-Judge（后文详述，用于细判正确性与有用性），以及 RAG 场景下的忠实度、相关性等。

**Latency Monitoring:** Latency Monitoring for Agent Actions is crucial in applications where the speed of an AI agent's response or action is a critical factor. This process measures the duration required for an agent to process requests and generate outputs. Elevated latency can adversely affect user experience and the agent's overall effectiveness, particularly in real-time or interactive environments. In practical applications, simply printing latency data to the console is insufficient. Logging this information to a persistent storage system is recommended. Options include structured log files (e.g., JSON), time-series databases (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus), data warehouses (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL), or observability platforms (e.g., Datadog, Splunk, Grafana Cloud).

> **延迟监控：** 当响应或行动速度决定体验时，监控智能体端到端延迟尤为关键，即度量从处理请求到产出结果所耗时间。高延迟会拖累用户体验与整体效果，在实时或强交互场景中尤其明显。生产上不宜只打印控制台，宜写入持久化层：结构化日志（如 JSON）、时序数据库（如 InfluxDB、Prometheus）、数据仓库（如 Snowflake、BigQuery、PostgreSQL）或可观测平台（如 Datadog、Splunk、Grafana Cloud）。

**Tracking Token Usage for LLM Interactions:** For LLM-powered agents, tracking token usage is crucial for managing costs and optimizing resource allocation. Billing for LLM interactions often depends on the number of tokens processed (input and output). Therefore, efficient token usage directly reduces operational expenses. Additionally, monitoring token counts helps identify potential areas for improvement in prompt engineering or response generation processes.

> **跟踪 LLM 交互的 token 用量：** 对 LLM 驱动的智能体而言，统计 token 用量是成本管控与容量规划的基础；多数计费按输入与输出 token 计。提高 token 利用效率可直接压缩开支；持续监控也有助于定位提示设计或生成策略上的优化点。

```python
# This is conceptual as actual token counting depends on the LLM API
class LLMInteractionMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.total_input_tokens = 0
        self.total_output_tokens = 0

    def record_interaction(self, prompt: str, response: str):
        # In a real scenario, use LLM API's token counter or a tokenizer
        input_tokens = len(prompt.split())  # Placeholder
        output_tokens = len(response.split())  # Placeholder
        self.total_input_tokens += input_tokens
        self.total_output_tokens += output_tokens
        print(f"Recorded interaction: Input tokens={input_tokens}, Output tokens={output_tokens}")

    def get_total_tokens(self):
        return self.total_input_tokens, self.total_output_tokens


# Example usage
monitor = LLMInteractionMonitor()
monitor.record_interaction("What is the capital of France?", "The capital of France is Paris.")
monitor.record_interaction("Tell me a joke.", "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!")
input_t, output_t = monitor.get_total_tokens()
print(f"Total input tokens: {input_t}, Total output tokens: {output_t}")
```

This section introduces a conceptual Python class, `LLMInteractionMonitor`, developed to track token usage in large language model interactions. The class incorporates counters for both input and output tokens. Its `record_interaction` method simulates token counting by splitting the prompt and response strings. In a practical implementation, specific LLM API tokenizers would be employed for precise token counts. As interactions occur, the monitor accumulates the total input and output token counts. The `get_total_tokens` method provides access to these cumulative totals, essential for cost management and optimization of LLM usage.

> 本节给出概念性 Python 类 `LLMInteractionMonitor`，用于累计大语言模型交互中的 token 用量，分别维护输入与输出计数。`record_interaction` 以分词数近似 token，线上应换用对应 API 的官方分词器。每次交互累加后，可通过 `get_total_tokens` 读取总量，支撑成本核算与用量优化。

**Custom Metric for "Helpfulness" using LLM-as-a-Judge:** Evaluating subjective qualities like an AI agent's "helpfulness" presents challenges beyond standard objective metrics. A potential framework involves using an LLM as an evaluator. This LLM-as-a-Judge approach assesses another AI agent's output based on predefined criteria for "helpfulness." Leveraging the advanced linguistic capabilities of LLMs, this method offers nuanced, human-like evaluations of subjective qualities, surpassing simple keyword matching or rule-based assessments. Though in development, this technique shows promise for automating and scaling qualitative evaluations.

> **以 LLM-as-a-Judge 度量「有用性」：** 「有用性」等主观维度难以单靠传统客观指标覆盖。一种可行做法是让 LLM 充当评委，按预先约定的有用性 rubric 评判另一智能体的输出；利用大模型的语言能力，可获得接近人类的细粒度判断，胜过关键词命中或硬编码规则。该路线仍在演进，但在自动化、规模化开展质性评估方面潜力较大。

The Python code defines a class LLMJudgeForLegalSurvey designed to evaluate the quality of legal survey questions using a generative AI model. It utilizes the google.`generativeai` library to interact with Gemini models.

> 该 Python 示例实现 `LLMJudgeForLegalSurvey` 类，借助生成式模型评判法律调研问卷的质量，并通过 `google.generativeai` 与 Gemini 交互。

The core functionality involves sending a survey question to the model along with a detailed rubric for evaluation. The rubric specifies five criteria for judging survey questions: Clarity & Precision, Neutrality & Bias, Relevance & Focus, Completeness, and Appropriateness for Audience. For each criterion, a score from 1 to 5 is assigned, and a detailed rationale and feedback are required in the output. The code constructs a prompt that includes the rubric and the survey question to be evaluated.

> 核心做法是把待评问题与详尽的评分 rubric 一并提交给模型。Rubric 覆盖五项：清晰度与精确性、中立性与偏见、相关性与聚焦、完整性、受众适配度；每项 1–5 分，并需附理由与改进建议。提示词由 rubric 与目标问题拼接而成。

The `judge_survey_question` method sends this prompt to the configured Gemini model, requesting a JSON response formatted according to the defined structure. The expected output JSON includes an overall score, a summary rationale, detailed feedback for each criterion, a list of concerns, and a recommended action. The class handles potential errors during the AI model interaction, such as JSON decoding issues or empty responses. The script demonstrates its operation by evaluating examples of legal survey questions, illustrating how the AI assesses quality based on the predefined criteria.

Before we conclude, let's examine various evaluation methods, considering their strengths and weaknesses.

> 结束前，先横向对比几类评估手段及其取舍。

| Evaluation Method | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Human Evaluation  | Captures subtle behavior | Difficult to scale, expensive, and time-consuming, as it considers subjective human factors. |
| LLM-as-a-Judge | Consistent, efficient, and scalable.  | Intermediate steps may be overlooked. Limited by LLM capabilities. |
| Automated Metrics  | Scalable, efficient, and objective | Potential limitation in capturing complete capabilities. |

> 上表各方法要点（中文说明）：人工评估善于捕捉细微行为，但成本高、难规模化且主观性强；LLM 评判相对一致、高效、易扩展，却可能漏看中间步骤并受模型能力上限制约；自动化指标易扩展、客观，但往往难以完整反映智能体的综合能力边界。

## Agents trajectories

> ## 智能体轨迹（Agents trajectories）

Evaluating agents' trajectories is essential, as traditional software tests are insufficient. Standard code yields predictable pass/fail results, whereas agents operate probabilistically, necessitating qualitative assessment of both the final output and the agent's trajectory—the sequence of steps taken to reach a solution. Evaluating multi-agent systems is challenging because they are constantly in flux. This requires developing sophisticated metrics that go beyond individual performance to measure the effectiveness of communication and teamwork. Moreover, the environments themselves are not static, demanding that evaluation methods, including test cases, adapt over time.

> 评估智能体轨迹十分关键，传统软件测试往往不够用：确定性代码尚可用通过/失败刻画，而智能体行为具有随机性，既要审最终输出，也要审抵达答案的行动序列（轨迹）。多智能体系统与环境都在持续变化，评估更难，需要超越单智能体绩效、能刻画沟通与协作质量的复合指标；测试设计与用例也需随环境演化而更新。

This involves examining the quality of decisions, the reasoning process, and the overall outcome. Implementing automated evaluations is valuable, particularly for development beyond the prototype stage. Analyzing trajectory and tool use includes evaluating the steps an agent employs to achieve a goal, such as tool selection, strategies, and task efficiency. For example, an agent addressing a customer's product query might ideally follow a trajectory involving intent determination, database search tool use, result review, and report generation. The agent's actual actions are compared to this expected, or ground truth, trajectory to identify errors and inefficiencies. Comparison methods include exact match (requiring a perfect match to the ideal sequence), in-order match (correct actions in order, allowing extra steps), any-order match (correct actions in any order, allowing extra steps), precision (measuring the relevance of predicted actions), recall (measuring how many essential actions are captured), and single-tool use (checking for a specific action). Metric selection depends on specific agent requirements, with high-stakes scenarios potentially demanding an exact match, while more flexible situations might use an in-order or any-order match.

> 这要求同时审视决策质量、推理链路与最终结果。越过原型阶段后，自动化轨迹评估价值尤为突出。对工具使用的分析包括工具选型、策略选择与任务效率等维度。例如处理客户产品咨询时，理想轨迹可能是：识别意图、调用数据库检索、复核结果、生成答复。将实际轨迹与期望（金标准）对比，可定位错误与浪费。常见比对方式含精确匹配、保序匹配（允许插入冗余步骤）、任意序匹配（同样允许冗余）、精确率、召回率以及针对单一关键工具的检查等，需按业务风险在严格与宽松之间取舍。

Evaluation of AI agents involves two primary approaches: using test files and using evalset files. Test files, in JSON format, represent single, simple agent-model interactions or sessions and are ideal for unit testing during active development, focusing on rapid execution and simple session complexity. Each test file contains a single session with multiple turns, where a turn is a user-agent interaction including the user’s query, expected tool use trajectory, intermediate agent responses, and final response. For example, a test file might detail a user request to “Turn off `device_2` in the Bedroom,” specifying the agent’s use of a `set_device_info` tool with parameters like location: Bedroom, `device_id: device_2`, and status: OFF, and an expected final response of “I have set the `device_2` status to off.” Test files can be organized into folders and may include a `test_config`.json file to define evaluation criteria. Evalset files utilize a dataset called an “evalset” to evaluate interactions, containing multiple potentially lengthy sessions suited for simulating complex, multi-turn conversations and integration tests. An evalset file comprises multiple “evals,” each representing a distinct session with one or more “turns” that include user queries, expected tool use, intermediate responses, and a reference final response. An example evalset might include a session where the user first asks “What can you do?” and then says “Roll a 10 sided dice twice and then check if 9 is a prime or not,” defining expected `roll_die` tool calls and a `check_prime` tool call, along with the final response summarizing the dice rolls and the prime check.

> AI 智能体评估常见两类载体：**测试文件（test files）**与 **evalset 文件**。测试文件多为 JSON，描述相对简单的单次智能体—模型会话，适合开发期的快速单测，强调结构清晰、执行轻量。单文件通常对应一个多轮会话；每轮包含用户查询、期望的工具调用轨迹、中间回复与最终回复。例如用户说「把卧室里的 `device_2` 关掉」，期望调用 `set_device_info`（如 location: Bedroom、`device_id: device_2`、status: OFF），并以「已将 `device_2` 关闭」一类话术收尾。测试集可按目录组织，并辅以 `test_config.json` 声明评估规则。**Evalset** 则面向更贴近集成的场景：一个 evalset 可收录多条较长会话，用于复杂多轮对话或端到端回归；文件内包含多条 eval，每条 eval 含一个或多个 turn，字段同样覆盖查询、期望工具轨迹、中间态与参考终答。示例会话：用户先问能力边界，再要求「掷两次十面骰并判断 9 是否质数」，并校验应出现的 `roll_die`、`check_prime` 等调用及最终汇总回复。

**Multi-agents**: Evaluating a complex AI system with multiple agents is much like assessing a team project. Because there are many steps and handoffs, its complexity is an advantage, allowing you to check the quality of work at each stage. You can examine how well each individual "agent" performs its specific job, but you must also evaluate how the entire system is performing as a whole.

> **多智能体：** 评估多智能体复杂系统，很像评审团队项目：环节与交接多，反而便于按阶段设检查点；既要衡量各角色的专责完成度，也要衡量系统整体的协同效果。

To do this, you ask key questions about the team's dynamics, supported by concrete examples:

> 可围绕协作动态列出检查清单，并结合具体场景验证：

* Are the agents cooperating effectively? For instance, after a 'Flight-Booking Agent' secures a flight, does it successfully pass the correct dates and destination to the 'Hotel-Booking Agent'? A failure in cooperation could lead to a hotel being booked for the wrong week.  
* Did they create a good plan and stick to it? Imagine the plan is to first book a flight, then a hotel. If the 'Hotel Agent' tries to book a room before the flight is confirmed, it has deviated from the plan. You also check if an agent gets stuck, for example, endlessly searching for a "perfect" rental car and never moving on to the next step.  
* Is the right agent being chosen for the right task? If a user asks about the weather for their trip, the system should use a specialized 'Weather Agent' that provides live data. If it instead uses a 'General Knowledge Agent' that gives a generic answer like "it's usually warm in summer," it has chosen the wrong tool for the job.  
* Finally, does adding more agents improve performance? If you add a new 'Restaurant-Reservation Agent' to the team, does it make the overall trip-planning better and more efficient? Or does it create conflicts and slow the system down, indicating a problem with scalability?.

> * **协作是否闭环？** 例如航班代理出票后，是否把准确日期与目的地交接给酒店代理？若握手失败，可能出现「订对航班、订错周」的荒诞结果。  
> * **计划是否被遵守？** 既定顺序是先机票后酒店时，酒店代理是否在确认舱位前就锁房？亦需留意某个代理是否陷入「找完美租车」式死循环。  
> * **角色是否匹配任务？** 用户问行程天气，应路由到能拉实时数据的天气代理；若通识代理只回一句「夏天一般很热」，属于典型的工具错配。

## From Agents to Advanced Contractors

> ## 从智能体到高级「承包商（Contractors）」

 Recently, it has been proposed (Agent Companion, gulli et al.) an evolution from simple AI agents to advanced "contractors", moving from probabilistic, often unreliable systems to more deterministic and accountable ones designed for complex, high-stakes environments (see Fig.2)

> 近期研究（Agent Companion，Gulli 等）提出从简单 AI 智能体演进到高级「承包商」：从概率性强、可靠性参差的设计，转向面向复杂高风险任务、更可预期且可追责的体系（见图 2）。

 Today's common AI agents operate on brief, underspecified instructions, which makes them suitable for simple demonstrations but brittle in production, where ambiguity leads to failure. The "contractor" model addresses this by establishing a rigorous, formalized relationship between the user and the AI, built upon a foundation of clearly defined and mutually agreed-upon terms, much like a legal service agreement in the human world. This transformation is supported by four key pillars that collectively ensure clarity, reliability, and robust execution of tasks that were previously beyond the scope of autonomous systems

> 当下许多智能体仍依赖简短、含糊的指令，演示尚可，上线却易因歧义翻车。「承包商」范式通过在用户与 AI 之间缔结严谨、可执行的约定来应对：条款清晰、双方确认，类比人类世界中的服务合同。其背后有四根支柱协同保障透明、可靠与稳健交付，让过去难以交给自主系统的高难任务变得可托付。

First is the pillar of the Formalized Contract, a detailed specification that serves as the single source of truth for a task. It goes far beyond a simple prompt. For example, a contract for a financial analysis task wouldn't just say "analyze last quarter's sales"; it would demand "a 20-page PDF report analyzing European market sales from Q1 2025, including five specific data visualizations, a comparative analysis against Q1 2024, and a risk assessment based on the included dataset of supply chain disruptions." This contract explicitly defines the required deliverables, their precise specifications, the acceptable data sources, the scope of work, and even the expected computational cost and completion time, making the outcome objectively verifiable.

> 第一支柱是**正式化合约（Formalized Contract）**：以详尽规格充当任务的单一事实来源，远非一句提示所能替代。例如金融分析不会仅说「分析上季销售」，而会写明「提交 20 页 PDF，剖析 2025 年 Q1 欧洲区销售，附五类指定图表、同比 2024 年 Q1 的对照，并基于随附供应链扰动数据给出风险评估」。合约锁定交付物形态、技术规格、可用数据源、工作边界乃至算力与工期预期，使验收有据可依。

Second is the pillar of a Dynamic Lifecycle of Negotiation and Feedback. The contract is not a static command but the start of a dialogue. The contractor agent can analyze the initial terms and negotiate. For instance, if a contract demands the use of a specific proprietary data source the agent cannot access, it can return feedback stating, "The specified XYZ database is inaccessible. Please provide credentials or approve the use of an alternative public database, which may slightly alter the data's granularity." This negotiation phase, which also allows the agent to flag ambiguities or potential risks, resolves misunderstandings before execution begins, preventing costly failures and ensuring the final output aligns perfectly with the user's actual intent.

> 第二支柱是**谈判与反馈的动态生命周期**。合约不是一次性命令，而是协商的起点；承包商智能体可先审条款再反馈。若约定了无法访问的专有库，可回复：「XYZ 库当前不可达，请提供凭证，或授权改用公开替代源（粒度可能略有差异）。」这一阶段也用于提前暴露歧义与风险，减少上线后的返工与损失，并让交付更贴近用户真实意图。

> 图 2：智能体之间的合约执行示例

The third pillar is Quality-Focused Iterative Execution. Unlike agents designed for low-latency responses, a contractor prioritizes correctness and quality. It operates on a principle of self-validation and correction. For a code generation contract, for example, the agent would not just write the code; it would generate multiple algorithmic approaches, compile and run them against a suite of unit tests defined within the contract, score each solution on metrics like performance, security, and readability, and only submit the version that passes all validation criteria. This internal loop of generating, reviewing, and improving its own work until the contract's specifications are met is crucial for building trust in its outputs.

> 第三支柱是**以质量为中心的迭代执行**。与一味追求秒回不同，承包商把正确性与质量放在首位，内置自我校验与纠错。以代码生成为例：不只产出一份实现，还会并行尝试多种方案，在合约附带的单测上编译运行，从性能、安全、可读性等维度评分，仅提交满足全部门槛的版本。在规格达成前反复「生成—自检—改进」，是赢得信任的关键。

Finally, the fourth pillar is Hierarchical Decomposition via Subcontracts. For tasks of significant complexity, a primary contractor agent can act as a project manager, breaking the main goal into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks. It achieves this by generating new, formal "subcontracts." For example, a master contract to "build an e-commerce mobile application" could be decomposed by the primary agent into subcontracts for "designing the UI/UX," "developing the user authentication module," "creating the product database schema," and "integrating a payment gateway." Each of these subcontracts is a complete, independent contract with its own deliverables and specifications, which could be assigned to other specialized agents. This structured decomposition allows the system to tackle immense, multifaceted projects in a highly organized and scalable manner, marking the transition of AI from a simple tool to a truly autonomous and reliable problem-solving engine.

> 第四支柱是**借助子合约做层级分解**。面对超大任务，主承包商可像项目经理一样拆分目标，并为子任务签发正式的「子合约」。例如总目标是「交付电商移动应用」，可拆出 UI/UX、身份认证、商品库 schema、支付对接等子合约；每份子合约自带交付清单与验收标准，可再分包给专科智能体。结构化拆解让系统能以可治理、可扩展的方式承接复杂项目，推动 AI 从被动工具演进为可托付的自主求解引擎。

Ultimately, this contractor framework reimagines AI interaction by embedding principles of formal specification, negotiation, and verifiable execution directly into the agent's core logic. This methodical approach elevates artificial intelligence from a promising but often unpredictable assistant into a dependable system capable of autonomously managing complex projects with auditable precision. By solving the critical challenges of ambiguity and reliability, this model paves the way for deploying AI in mission-critical domains where trust and accountability are paramount.

> 归根结底，承包商框架把正式规格、协商机制与可验证执行写进智能体的核心逻辑，重塑人机协作方式：AI 由「看似聪明却难预测」的助手，升级为能以可审计方式操盘复杂项目的可靠伙伴。直面歧义与可靠性两大痛点，该范式为在强监管、强问责场景落地 AI 提供了路径。

## Google's ADK

> ## Google ADK

Before concluding, let's look at a concrete example of a framework that supports evaluation. Agent evaluation with Google's ADK (see Fig.3) can be conducted via three methods: web-based UI (adk web) for interactive evaluation and dataset generation, programmatic integration using pytest for incorporation into testing pipelines, and direct command-line interface (adk eval) for automated evaluations suitable for regular build generation and verification processes.

> 收尾前看一个带评估能力的框架示例。借助 Google ADK（见图 3）评估智能体，大致有三条路：用 Web UI（`adk web`）做交互评测与数据集沉淀；用 pytest 将评估嵌入 CI/CD；或用 CLI（`adk eval`）在构建与回归中批量跑分。

The web-based UI enables interactive session creation and saving into existing or new eval sets, displaying evaluation status. Pytest integration allows running test files as part of integration tests by calling AgentEvaluator.evaluate, specifying the agent module and test file path.

> Web UI 可交互式创建会话，写入既有或新建的 eval 集，并实时展示评估状态。结合 pytest 时，调用 `AgentEvaluator.evaluate` 并传入智能体模块与测试文件路径，即可把单测用例纳入集成流水线。

The command-line interface facilitates automated evaluation by providing the agent module path and eval set file, with options to specify a configuration file or print detailed results. Specific evals within a larger eval set can be selected for execution by listing them after the eval set filename, separated by commas.

> CLI 通过指定智能体模块与 eval 集文件触发自动化评估，可附加配置文件或输出明细；亦可在 eval 集名后以逗号枚举要跑的子 eval。

## At a Glance

> ## 要点速览

**What:** Agentic systems and LLMs operate in complex, dynamic environments where their performance can degrade over time. Their probabilistic and non-deterministic nature means that traditional software testing is insufficient for ensuring reliability. Evaluating dynamic multi-agent systems is a significant challenge because their constantly changing nature and that of their environments demand the development of adaptive testing methods and sophisticated metrics that can measure collaborative success beyond individual performance. Problems like data drift, unexpected interactions, tool calling, and deviations from intended goals can arise after deployment. Continuous assessment is therefore necessary to measure an agent's effectiveness, efficiency, and adherence to operational and safety requirements.

> **是什么：** 智能体与 LLM 处在复杂多变环境中，性能会随时间衰减；概率输出让传统测试难以覆盖全部风险。多智能体系统与环境共同演化，更需自适应的测试策略，以及能刻画协作质量而不只看单体分数的指标。上线后还可能出现数据漂移、工具误用、链路意外与目标偏移，因此必须持续度量有效性、效率以及对运营规范与安全红线的遵守情况。

**Why:** A standardized evaluation and monitoring framework provides a systematic way to assess and ensure the ongoing performance of intelligent agents. This involves defining clear metrics for accuracy, latency, and resource consumption, like token usage for LLMs. It also includes advanced techniques such as analyzing agentic trajectories to understand the reasoning process and employing an LLM-as-a-Judge for nuanced, qualitative assessments. By establishing feedback loops and reporting systems, this framework allows for continuous improvement, A/B testing, and the detection of anomalies or performance drift, ensuring the agent remains aligned with its objectives.

> **为什么：** 统一的评估与监控体系，为持续衡量并守护智能体表现提供方法论：既要为准确率、时延、资源（如 token）建立可量化指标，也要借助轨迹分析理解推理链路，并用 LLM-as-a-Judge 等手段补充质性判断。配合反馈闭环与报表机制，可支撑迭代优化、对照实验，以及对异常与漂移的早期发现，让系统始终对齐业务与安全目标。

**Rule of Thumb:** Use this pattern when deploying agents in live, production environments where real-time performance and reliability are critical. Additionally, use it when needing to systematically compare different versions of an agent or its underlying models to drive improvements, and when operating in regulated or high-stakes domains requiring compliance, safety, and ethical audits. This pattern is also suitable when an agent's performance may degrade over time due to changes in data or the environment (drift), or when evaluating complex agentic behavior, including the sequence of actions (trajectory) and the quality of subjective outputs like helpfulness.

> **经验法则：** 生产环境对实时性与可靠性要求高时应采用本模式；需要成体系对比智能体版本或底座模型以指导迭代时也应采用；面临合规、安全、伦理审计等强约束时同样适用；当数据或环境变化可能诱发性能漂移，或需评估复杂行为（行动轨迹、主观维度如「有用性」）时，本模式尤为关键。

## Conclusions

> ## 结论

In conclusion, effectively evaluating AI agents requires moving beyond simple accuracy checks to a continuous, multi-faceted assessment of their performance in dynamic environments. This involves practical monitoring of metrics like latency and resource consumption, as well as sophisticated analysis of an agent's decision-making process through its trajectory. For nuanced qualities like helpfulness, innovative methods such as the LLM-as-a-Judge are becoming essential, while frameworks like Google's ADK provide structured tools for both unit and integration testing. The challenge intensifies with multi-agent systems, where the focus shifts to evaluating collaborative success and effective cooperation.

> 总之，评估 AI 智能体不能只盯准确率，而要在动态环境里持续、立体地观测：既跟踪延迟与资源等硬指标，也借助轨迹还原决策链路。对「有用性」这类软指标，LLM-as-a-Judge 正成为常用补充；Google ADK 等工具则把单测与集成评估产品化。多智能体场景进一步抬高难度，评估重心自然转向协作质量与任务衔接。

To ensure reliability in critical applications, the paradigm is shifting from simple, prompt-driven agents to advanced "contractors" bound by formal agreements. These contractor agents operate on explicit, verifiable terms, allowing them to negotiate, decompose tasks, and self-validate their work to meet rigorous quality standards. This structured approach transforms agents from unpredictable tools into accountable systems capable of handling complex, high-stakes tasks. Ultimately, this evolution is crucial for building the trust required to deploy sophisticated agentic AI in mission-critical domains.
