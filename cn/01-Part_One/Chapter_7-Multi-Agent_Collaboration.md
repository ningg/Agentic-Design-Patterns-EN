# Chapter 7: Multi-Agent Collaboration

While a monolithic agent architecture can be effective for well-defined problems, its capabilities are often constrained when faced with complex, multi-domain tasks. The Multi-Agent Collaboration pattern addresses these limitations by structuring a system as a cooperative ensemble of distinct, specialized agents. This approach is predicated on the principle of task decomposition, where a high-level objective is broken down into discrete sub-problems. Each sub-problem is then assigned to an agent possessing the specific tools, data access, or reasoning capabilities best suited for that task.

> 单体智能体架构在边界清晰的问题上往往行之有效，但面对复杂、跨领域任务时，其能力很容易触及瓶颈。多智能体协作模式通过将系统组织为彼此配合、角色各异的专业化智能体集合，来化解这些局限。其前提是任务分解：先将高层目标拆解为离散子问题，再分别指派给在工具、数据访问或推理能力上最为契合的智能体。

For example, a complex research query might be decomposed and assigned to a Research Agent for information retrieval, a Data Analysis Agent for statistical processing, and a Synthesis Agent for generating the final report. The efficacy of such a system is not merely due to the division of labor but is critically dependent on the mechanisms for inter-agent communication. This requires a standardized communication protocol and a shared ontology, allowing agents to exchange data, delegate sub-tasks, and coordinate their actions to ensure the final output is coherent.

> 例如，复杂研究查询可拆解为：研究智能体负责检索、数据分析智能体负责统计处理、综合智能体负责撰写最终报告。此类系统的成效不仅源于分工，更取决于智能体之间的通信机制：须依托标准化协议与共享本体，使智能体能够交换数据、委派子任务并协调行动，从而保证最终产出连贯一致。

This distributed architecture offers several advantages, including enhanced modularity, scalability, and robustness, as the failure of a single agent does not necessarily cause a total system failure. The collaboration allows for a synergistic outcome where the collective performance of the multi-agent system surpasses the potential capabilities of any single agent within the ensemble.

> 这种分布式架构带来更高的模块化、可扩展性与鲁棒性：单个智能体失效未必拖垮整体。协作可形成协同效应，使多智能体系统的整体表现超越其中任一单体的潜在上限。

## Multi-Agent Collaboration Pattern Overview

The Multi-Agent Collaboration pattern involves designing systems where multiple independent or semi-independent agents work together to achieve a common goal. Each agent typically has a defined role, specific goals aligned with the overall objective, and potentially access to different tools or knowledge bases. The power of this pattern lies in the interaction and synergy between these agents.

> 多智能体协作模式，是指设计由多个独立或半独立智能体协同达成共同目标的系统。各智能体通常具备清晰的角色、与总体目标对齐的子目标，并可调用不同的工具或知识库；该模式的力量，来自智能体之间的交互以及协同放大效应。

Collaboration can take various forms:

> 协作可呈现多种形式：

* **Sequential Handoffs:** One agent completes a task and passes its output to another agent for the next step in a pipeline (similar to the Planning pattern, but explicitly involving different agents).  
* **Parallel Processing:** Multiple agents work on different parts of a problem simultaneously, and their results are later combined.  
* **Debate and Consensus:** Multi-Agent Collaboration where Agents with varied perspectives and information sources engage in discussions to evaluate options, ultimately reaching a consensus or a more informed decision.  
* **Hierarchical Structures:** A manager agent might delegate tasks to worker agents dynamically based on their tool access or plugin capabilities and synthesize their results. Each agent can also handle relevant groups of tools, rather than a single agent handling all the tools.  
* **Expert Teams:** Agents with specialized knowledge in different domains (e.g., a researcher, a writer, an editor) collaborate to produce a complex output.
* **Critic-Reviewer:** Agents create initial outputs such as plans, drafts, or answers. A second group of agents then critically assesses this output for adherence to policies, security, compliance, correctness, quality, and alignment with organizational objectives. The original creator or a final agent revises the output based on this feedback. This pattern is particularly effective for code generation, research writing, logic checking, and ensuring ethical alignment. The advantages of this approach include increased robustness, improved quality, and a reduced likelihood of hallucinations or errors.

> * **顺序交接：** 某一智能体完成后将输出移交给下一智能体，以推进流水线的下一步（与规划模式相近，但显式涉及多个智能体）。
> * **并行处理：** 多个智能体同时处理问题的不同片段，随后再合并结果。
> * **辩论与共识：** 持有不同视角与信息源的智能体通过讨论评估备选项，最终形成共识或更具信息量的决策。
> * **层级结构：** 管理者智能体可依据下属的工具或插件能力动态分派任务并汇总结果；各智能体亦可分管工具子集，避免由单一智能体包揽全部工具。
> * **专家团队：** 具备不同领域专长的智能体（如研究、写作、编辑）协作产出复杂成果。
> * **批评者—审阅者：** 一组智能体产出初稿类成果（计划、草稿或答复）；另一组智能体从政策遵循、安全、合规、正确性、质量及与组织目标的对齐等维度进行批判性审阅；由原作者或终审智能体据反馈修订。该模式特别适用于代码生成、研究写作、逻辑校验与伦理对齐等场景，有助于提升鲁棒性与输出质量，并降低幻觉与差错风险。

A multi-agent system (see Fig.1) fundamentally comprises the delineation of agent roles and responsibilities, the establishment of communication channels through which agents exchange information, and the formulation of a task flow or interaction protocol that directs their collaborative endeavors.

> 多智能体系统（见图 1）在结构上至少包含三个关键要素：明确各智能体的角色与职责、建立信息交换通道，以及制定引导协作的任务流或交互协议。

Frameworks such as Crew AI and Google ADK are engineered to facilitate this paradigm by providing structures for the specification of agents, tasks, and their interactive procedures. This approach is particularly effective for challenges necessitating a variety of specialized knowledge, encompassing multiple discrete phases, or leveraging the advantages of concurrent processing and the corroboration of information across agents.

> Crew AI、Google ADK 等框架提供描述智能体、任务及其交互流程的结构化能力，以承载该范式；在需要多种专业知识、经历多个离散阶段，或希望借助并发与跨智能体信息互证时尤为奏效。

## Practical Applications & Use Cases

Multi-Agent Collaboration is a powerful pattern applicable across numerous domains:

> 多智能体协作是一种在众多领域都极具潜力的模式：

* **Complex Research and Analysis:** A team of agents could collaborate on a research project. One agent might specialize in searching academic databases, another in summarizing findings, a third in identifying trends, and a fourth in synthesizing the information into a report. This mirrors how a human research team might operate.  
* **Software Development:** Imagine agents collaborating on building software. One agent could be a requirements analyst, another a code generator, a third a tester, and a fourth a documentation writer. They could pass outputs between each other to build and verify components.  
* **Creative Content Generation:** Creating a marketing campaign could involve a market research agent, a copywriter agent, a graphic design agent (using image generation tools), and a social media scheduling agent, all working together.  
* **Financial Analysis:** A multi-agent system could analyze financial markets. Agents might specialize in fetching stock data, analyzing news sentiment, performing technical analysis, and generating investment recommendations.  
* **Customer Support Escalation:** A front-line support agent could handle initial queries, escalating complex issues to a specialist agent (e.g., a technical expert or a billing specialist) when needed, demonstrating a sequential handoff based on problem complexity.  
* **Supply Chain Optimization:** Agents could represent different nodes in a supply chain (suppliers, manufacturers, distributors) and collaborate to optimize inventory levels, logistics, and scheduling in response to changing demand or disruptions.  
* **Network Analysis & Remediation**: Autonomous operations benefit greatly from an agentic architecture, particularly in failure pinpointing. Multiple agents can collaborate to triage and remediate issues, suggesting optimal actions. These agents can also integrate with traditional machine learning models and tooling, leveraging existing systems while simultaneously offering the advantages of Generative AI.

> * **复杂研究与分析：** 多智能体可像人类研究团队那样分工：分别负责学术库检索、文献摘要、趋势研判与报告综合。
> * **软件开发：** 可设想由需求分析、代码生成、测试、文档等智能体依次传递产出，共同构建与验证组件。
> * **创意内容生成：** 营销活动可串联市场调研、文案、平面设计（图像生成工具）与社交媒体排期等智能体协同完成。
> * **金融分析：** 可分别专精行情拉取、新闻情绪、技术分析与投资建议等子任务。
> * **客服升级：** 一线智能体处理常规咨询，复杂问题按难度逐级交接给技术或账务专家智能体。
> * **供应链优化：** 以智能体映射供应商、制造商、分销商等节点，协同优化库存、物流与排期，以响应需求波动或突发扰动。
> * **网络分析与修复：** 自主运维尤其受益于智能体架构以定位故障；多智能体可协作完成分诊、修复建议与最优动作推荐，亦可与传统机器学习及运维工具集成，在复用既有系统的同时发挥生成式 AI 的长处。

The capacity to delineate specialized agents and meticulously orchestrate their interrelationships empowers developers to construct systems exhibiting enhanced modularity, scalability, and the ability to address complexities that would prove insurmountable for a singular, integrated agent.

> 通过清晰划分专业化智能体并精心编排其相互关系，开发者能够构建出模块化程度更高、更易扩展，也足以应对单体集成智能体难以驾驭之复杂度的系统。

## Multi-Agent Collaboration: Exploring Interrelationships and Communication Structures

Understanding the intricate ways in which agents interact and communicate is fundamental to designing effective multi-agent systems. As depicted in Fig. 2, a spectrum of interrelationship and communication models exists, ranging from the simplest single-agent scenario to complex, custom-designed collaborative frameworks. Each model presents unique advantages and challenges, influencing the overall efficiency, robustness, and adaptability of the multi-agent system.

> 理解智能体如何交互与通信，是设计高效多智能体系统的根基。如图 2 所示，从最简单的单智能体，到复杂的定制化协作框架，存在一整条关系与通信模型的谱系；各类模型各有优劣，并共同塑造系统的整体效率、鲁棒性与适应性。

### 1. Single Agent

At the most basic level, a "Single Agent" operates autonomously without direct interaction or communication with other entities. While this model is straightforward to implement and manage, its capabilities are inherently limited by the individual agent's scope and resources. It is suitable for tasks that are decomposable into independent sub-problems, each solvable by a single, self-sufficient agent.

> 在最基础层面，「单智能体」自主运行，不与其他实体直接交互或通信；实现与管理成本较低，但能力受单体范围与资源约束。适用于可拆为彼此独立子问题、且每个子问题均可由自给自足的智能体单独解决的任务。

### 2. Network

The "Network" model represents a significant step towards collaboration, where multiple agents interact directly with each other in a decentralized fashion. Communication typically occurs peer-to-peer, allowing for the sharing of information, resources, and even tasks. This model fosters resilience, as the failure of one agent does not necessarily cripple the entire system. However, managing communication overhead and ensuring coherent decision-making in a large, unstructured network can be challenging.

> 「网络」模型标志着向协作迈进的重要一步：多智能体以去中心化方式互联，通常采用点对点通信共享信息、资源乃至任务分配；单点失效未必瘫痪全局，因而更具韧性。但在规模庞大且拓扑松散的网络中，控制通信开销并维持决策一致性往往颇具挑战。

### 3. Supervisor

In the "Supervisor" model, a dedicated agent, the "supervisor," oversees and coordinates the activities of a group of subordinate agents. The supervisor acts as a central hub for communication, task allocation, and conflict resolution. This hierarchical structure offers clear lines of authority and can simplify management and control. However, it introduces a single point of failure (the supervisor) and can become a bottleneck if the supervisor is overwhelmed by a large number of subordinates or complex tasks.

> “监督者”模型由专职监督智能体统筹下属群体，充当通信、任务分派与冲突调解的中心枢纽：这种层级结构权责清晰、便于管控，但监督者本身也会带来单点故障风险，并且在下属数量庞大或任务高度复杂时，容易演变为性能瓶颈。

### 4. Supervisor as a Tool

This model is a nuanced extension of the "Supervisor" concept, where the supervisor's role is less about direct command and control and more about providing resources, guidance, or analytical support to other agents. The supervisor might offer tools, data, or computational services that enable other agents to perform their tasks more effectively, without necessarily dictating their every action. This approach aims to leverage the supervisor's capabilities without imposing rigid top-down control.

> 这是对「监督者」角色的细化延伸：监督者较少直接发号施令，更多向其他智能体提供资源、指导或分析型支持（工具、数据、算力等），未必干预每一步行动；旨在释放监督者的能力优势，同时规避过度僵化的自上而下控制。

### 5. Hierarchical

The "Hierarchical" model expands upon the supervisor concept to create a multi-layered organizational structure. This involves multiple levels of supervisors, with higher-level supervisors overseeing lower-level ones, and ultimately, a collection of operational agents at the lowest tier. This structure is well-suited for complex problems that can be decomposed into sub-problems, each managed by a specific layer of the hierarchy. It provides a structured approach to scalability and complexity management, allowing for distributed decision-making within defined boundaries.

> 「层级」模型将监督关系扩展为多层组织：高层监督低层，最底层为执行型智能体集群；适用于可递归分解、并由不同层级分别承接的复杂问题，为扩展性与复杂性治理提供结构化抓手，同时在既定边界内保留分布式决策空间。

Fig. 2: Agents communicate and interact in various ways.

> 图 2：智能体以多种拓扑与机制进行通信与交互。

### 6. Custom

The "Custom" model represents the ultimate flexibility in multi-agent system design. It allows for the creation of unique interrelationship and communication structures tailored precisely to the specific requirements of a given problem or application. This can involve hybrid approaches that combine elements from the previously mentioned models, or entirely novel designs that emerge from the unique constraints and opportunities of the environment. Custom models often arise from the need to optimize for specific performance metrics, handle highly dynamic environments, or incorporate domain-specific knowledge into the system's architecture. Designing and implementing custom models typically requires a deep understanding of multi-agent systems principles and careful consideration of communication protocols, coordination mechanisms, and emergent behaviors.

> 「定制」模型体现多智能体设计上的最高灵活度：可针对特定问题或应用场景量身构建关系与通信拓扑，既可糅合前述模型的要素，也可依据环境约束与机遇从零设计；往往出于对关键性能指标的优化、对高度动态环境的适应，或将领域知识嵌入架构的需要。设计与实现通常要求深入掌握多智能体基本原则，并对通信协议、协调机制与涌现行为作周密权衡。

In summary, the choice of interrelationship and communication model for a multi-agent system is a critical design decision. Each model offers distinct advantages and disadvantages, and the optimal choice depends on factors such as the complexity of the task, the number of agents, the desired level of autonomy, the need for robustness, and the acceptable communication overhead. Future advancements in multi-agent systems will likely continue to explore and refine these models, as well as develop new paradigms for collaborative intelligence.

> 总之，关系与通信模型的取舍是关键设计决策；最优方案取决于任务复杂度、智能体规模、期望的自主程度、鲁棒性目标以及可承受的通信开销等因素。未来多智能体研究有望在这些模型上持续迭代，并孕育协作智能的新范式。

## Hands-On code (Crew AI)

This Python code defines an AI-powered crew using the CrewAI framework to generate a blog post about AI trends. It starts by setting up the environment, loading API keys from a .env file. The core of the application involves defining two agents: a researcher to find and summarize AI trends, and a writer to create a blog post based on the research.

Two tasks are defined accordingly: one for researching the trends and another for writing the blog post, with the writing task depending on the output of the research task. These agents and tasks are then assembled into a Crew, specifying a sequential process where tasks are executed in order. The Crew is initialized with the agents, tasks, and a language model (specifically the "gemini-2.0-flash" model). The main function executes this crew using the kickoff() method, orchestrating the collaboration between the agents to produce the desired output. Finally, the code prints the final result of the crew's execution, which is the generated blog post.

> 该 Python 示例借助 CrewAI 组建一个 AI crew，用于生成关于 AI 趋势的博客文章：先配置运行环境并从 `.env` 读取 API 密钥；核心角色为两名智能体——研究员负责检索并汇总趋势，作者依据研究结论撰写博文；任务与角色一一对应，写作任务显式依赖研究任务的输出；随后将二者编入 Crew，并设定为顺序执行流程，以 `gemini-2.0-flash` 等模型作为 LLM；在 `main` 中通过 `kickoff()` 编排协作并输出最终博文。

We will now delve into further examples within the Google ADK framework, with particular emphasis on hierarchical, parallel, and sequential coordination paradigms, alongside the implementation of an agent as an operational instrument.

> 下文将进一步展开 Google ADK 中的示例，重点覆盖层级、并行与顺序等协调范式，并演示如何将智能体封装为可调用工具。

## Hands-on Code (Google ADK)

The following code example demonstrates the establishment of a hierarchical agent structure within the Google ADK through the creation of a parent-child relationship. The code defines two types of agents: LlmAgent and a custom TaskExecutor agent derived from BaseAgent. The TaskExecutor is designed for specific, non-LLM tasks and in this example, it simply yields a "Task finished successfully" event. An LlmAgent named greeter is initialized with a specified model and instruction to act as a friendly greeter. The custom TaskExecutor is instantiated as `task_doer`. A parent LlmAgent called coordinator is created, also with a model and instructions. The coordinator's instructions guide it to delegate greetings to the greeter and task execution to the `task_doer`. The greeter and `task_doer` are added as sub-agents to the coordinator, establishing a parent-child relationship. The code then asserts that this relationship is correctly set up. Finally, it prints a message indicating that the agent hierarchy has been successfully created.

> 以下示例演示如何在 Google ADK 中借助父子关系搭建层级智能体：一方面定义 LlmAgent，另一方面实现继承 BaseAgent 的 TaskExecutor（本例面向非 LLM 任务，仅产出「任务成功完成」事件）；分别实例化 greeter 与 `task_doer` 后，以 coordinator 作为父智能体，并在指令中要求将问候委派给 greeter、将任务执行委派给 `task_doer`；通过断言校验父子关系，最后打印层级创建成功的提示。

```python
from typing import AsyncGenerator

from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent, BaseAgent
from google.adk.agents.invocation_context import InvocationContext
from google.adk.events import Event


# Correctly implement a custom agent by extending BaseAgent
class TaskExecutor(BaseAgent):
    """A specialized agent with custom, non-LLM behavior."""
    name: str = "TaskExecutor"
    description: str = "Executes a predefined task."

    async def _run_async_impl(self, context: InvocationContext) -> AsyncGenerator[Event, None]:
        """Custom implementation logic for the task."""
        # This is where your custom logic would go.
        # For this example, we'll just yield a simple event.
        yield Event(author=self.name, content="Task finished successfully.")


# Define individual agents with proper initialization
# LlmAgent requires a model to be specified.
greeter = LlmAgent(
    name="Greeter",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
    instruction="You are a friendly greeter.",
)

# Instantiate our concrete custom agent
task_doer = TaskExecutor()

# Create a parent agent and assign its sub-agents
# The parent agent's description and instructions should guide its delegation logic.
coordinator = LlmAgent(
    name="Coordinator",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
    description="A coordinator that can greet users and execute tasks.",
    instruction="When asked to greet, delegate to the Greeter. When asked to perform a task, delegate to the TaskExecutor.",
    sub_agents=[
        greeter,
        task_doer,
    ],
)

# The ADK framework automatically establishes the parent-child relationships.
# These assertions will pass if checked after initialization.
assert greeter.parent_agent == coordinator
assert task_doer.parent_agent == coordinator

print("Agent hierarchy created successfully.")
```

This code excerpt illustrates the employment of the LoopAgent within the Google ADK framework to establish iterative workflows. The code defines two agents: ConditionChecker and ProcessingStep. ConditionChecker is a custom agent that checks a "status" value in the session state. If the "status" is "completed", ConditionChecker escalates an event to stop the loop. Otherwise, it yields an event to continue the loop. `ProcessingStep` is an LlmAgent using the "gemini-2.0-flash-exp" model. Its instruction is to perform a task and set the session `status` to "completed" if it's the final step. A LoopAgent named StatusPoller is created. StatusPoller is configured with `max_iterations=10`. StatusPoller includes both ProcessingStep and an instance of ConditionChecker as sub-agents. The LoopAgent will execute the sub-agents sequentially for up to 10 iterations, stopping if ConditionChecker finds the status is "completed".

> 该片段展示如何在 Google ADK 中用 LoopAgent 构造迭代工作流：ConditionChecker 读取会话状态中的 `status`，若为 `completed` 则通过升级事件结束循环，否则继续下一轮；ProcessingStep 为 LlmAgent，其指令要求在末步将 `status` 置为 `completed`；名为 StatusPoller 的 LoopAgent 将 `max_iterations` 设为 10，子智能体按序反复执行，直至条件满足或触及迭代上限。

```python
import asyncio
from typing import AsyncGenerator

from google.adk.agents import LoopAgent, LlmAgent, BaseAgent
from google.adk.events import Event, EventActions
from google.adk.agents.invocation_context import InvocationContext


# Best Practice: Define custom agents as complete, self-describing classes.
class ConditionChecker(BaseAgent):
    """A custom agent that checks for a 'completed' status in the session state."""
    name: str = "ConditionChecker"
    description: str = "Checks if a process is complete and signals the loop to stop."

    async def _run_async_impl(
        self, context: InvocationContext
    ) -> AsyncGenerator[Event, None]:
        """Checks state and yields an event to either continue or stop the loop."""
        status = context.session.state.get("status", "pending")
        is_done = status == "completed"

        if is_done:
            # Escalate to terminate the loop when the condition is met.
            yield Event(author=self.name, actions=EventActions(escalate=True))
        else:
            # Yield a simple event to continue the loop.
            yield Event(author=self.name, content="Condition not met, continuing loop.")


# Correction: The LlmAgent must have a model and clear instructions.
process_step = LlmAgent(
    name="ProcessingStep",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
    instruction=(
        "You are a step in a longer process. Perform your task. "
        "If you are the final step, update session state by setting 'status' to 'completed'."
    ),
)


# The LoopAgent orchestrates the workflow.
poller = LoopAgent(
    name="StatusPoller",
    max_iterations=10,
    sub_agents=[
        process_step,
        ConditionChecker(),  # Instantiating the well-defined custom agent.
    ],
)

# This poller will now execute 'process_step'
# and then 'ConditionChecker' repeatedly until the status is 'completed'
# or 10 iterations have passed.
```

This code excerpt elucidates the SequentialAgent pattern within the Google ADK, engineered for the construction of linear workflows. This code defines a sequential agent pipeline using the google.adk.agents library. The pipeline consists of two agents, step1 and step2. step1 is named `Step1_Fetch` and its output will be stored in the session state under the key `data`. step2 is named `Step2_Process` and is instructed to analyze the information stored in `session.state["data"]` and provide a summary. The SequentialAgent named "MyPipeline" orchestrates the execution of these sub-agents. When the pipeline is run with an initial input, step1 will execute first. The response from step1 will be saved into the session state under the key "data". Subsequently, step2 will execute, utilizing the information that step1 placed into the state as per its instruction. This structure allows for building workflows where the output of one agent becomes the input for the next. This is a common pattern in creating multi-step AI or data processing pipelines.

> 该片段说明 Google ADK 中 SequentialAgent 所构成的线性流水线：`Step1_Fetch` 将输出写入 `session.state["data"]`；`Step2_Process` 依据状态中的数据生成摘要；`MyPipeline` 负责按序编排子智能体，使前一步产出成为后一步输入——这一模式广泛见于多步 AI 或数据处理流水线。

```python
from google.adk.agents import SequentialAgent, Agent


# This agent's output will be saved to session.state["data"]
step1 = Agent(
    name="Step1_Fetch",
    output_key="data",
)

# This agent will use the data from the previous step.
# We instruct it on how to find and use this data.
step2 = Agent(
    name="Step2_Process",
    instruction="Analyze the information found in state['data'] and provide a summary.",
)

pipeline = SequentialAgent(
    name="MyPipeline",
    sub_agents=[step1, step2],
)

# When the pipeline is run with an initial input, Step1 will execute,
# its response will be stored in session.state["data"], and then
# Step2 will execute, using the information from the state as instructed.
```

The following code example illustrates the ParallelAgent pattern within the Google ADK, which facilitates the concurrent execution of multiple agent tasks. The `data_gatherer` is designed to run two sub-agents concurrently: `weather_fetcher` and `news_fetcher`. The `weather_fetcher` agent is instructed to get the weather for a given location and store the result in `session.state["weather_data"]`. Similarly, the `news_fetcher` agent is instructed to retrieve the top news story for a given topic and store it in `session.state["news_data"]`. Each sub-agent is configured to use the "gemini-2.0-flash-exp" model. The ParallelAgent orchestrates the execution of these sub-agents, allowing them to work in parallel. The results from both `weather_fetcher` and `news_fetcher` would be gathered and stored in the session state. Finally, the example shows how to access the collected weather and news data from the `final_state` after the agent's execution is complete.

> 以下示例展示 ParallelAgent 如何并发调度多路任务：`data_gatherer` 同时驱动 `weather_fetcher` 与 `news_fetcher`，分别把结果落入 `session.state["weather_data"]` 与 `news_data`；子智能体均配置为 gemini-2.0-flash-exp；运行结束后可从 `final_state` 汇总读取两侧产出（示意性片段）。

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent, ParallelAgent


# It's better to define the fetching logic as tools for the agents.
# For simplicity in this example, we'll embed the logic in the agent's instruction.
# In a real-world scenario, you would use tools.

# Define the individual agents that will run in parallel
weather_fetcher = Agent(
    name="weather_fetcher",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
    instruction="Fetch the weather for the given location and return only the weather report.",
    output_key="weather_data",  # The result will be stored in session.state["weather_data"]
)

news_fetcher = Agent(
    name="news_fetcher",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
    instruction="Fetch the top news story for the given topic and return only that story.",
    output_key="news_data",  # The result will be stored in session.state["news_data"]
)

# Create the ParallelAgent to orchestrate the sub-agents
data_gatherer = ParallelAgent(
    name="data_gatherer",
    sub_agents=[
        weather_fetcher,
        news_fetcher,
    ],
)
```

The provided code segment exemplifies the "Agent as a Tool" paradigm within the Google ADK, enabling an agent to utilize the capabilities of another agent in a manner analogous to function invocation. Specifically, the code defines an image generation system using Google's LlmAgent and AgentTool classes. It consists of two agents: a parent `artist_agent` and a sub-agent `image_generator_agent`. The `generate_image` function is a simple tool that simulates image creation, returning mock image data. The `image_generator_agent` is responsible for using this tool based on a text prompt it receives. The `artist_agent`'s role is to first invent a creative image prompt. It then calls the `image_generator_agent` through an AgentTool wrapper. The AgentTool acts as a bridge, allowing one agent to use another agent as a tool. When the `artist_agent` calls the `image_tool`, the AgentTool invokes the `image_generator_agent` with the artist's invented prompt. The `image_generator_agent` then uses the `generate_image` function with that prompt. Finally, the generated image (or mock data) is returned back up through the agents. This architecture demonstrates a layered agent system where a higher-level agent orchestrates a lower-level, specialized agent to perform a task.

> 该段阐释 Google ADK 中的「智能体即工具」范式：父级 `artist_agent` 与专责生图的子智能体 `image_generator_agent` 协同；`generate_image` 以模拟方式返回图像字节；`artist_agent` 先生成创意提示，再经 AgentTool 调用 `image_generator_agent`；下层智能体调用工具并回传（模拟）图像数据，体现由高层编排、低层专能承接的分层结构。

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from google.adk.tools import agent_tool
from google.genai import types


# 1. A simple function tool for the core capability.
# This follows the best practice of separating actions from reasoning.
def generate_image(prompt: str) -> dict:
    """
    Generates an image based on a textual prompt.

    Args:
        prompt: A detailed description of the image to generate.

    Returns:
        A dictionary with the status and the generated image bytes.
    """
    print(f"TOOL: Generating image for prompt: '{prompt}'")
    # In a real implementation, this would call an image generation API.
    # For this example, we return mock image data.
    mock_image_bytes = b"mock_image_data_for_a_cat_wearing_a_hat"
    return {
        "status": "success",
        # The tool returns the raw bytes, the agent will handle the Part creation.
        "image_bytes": mock_image_bytes,
        "mime_type": "image/png",
    }


# 2. Refactor the ImageGeneratorAgent into an LlmAgent.
# It now correctly uses the input passed to it.
image_generator_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="ImageGen",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    description="Generates an image based on a detailed text prompt.",
    instruction=(
        "You are an image generation specialist. Your task is to take the user's request "
        "and use the `generate_image` tool to create the image. "
        "The user's entire request should be used as the 'prompt' argument for the tool. "
        "After the tool returns the image bytes, you MUST output the image."
    ),
    tools=[generate_image],
)


# 3. Wrap the corrected agent in an AgentTool.
# The description here is what the parent agent sees.
image_tool = agent_tool.AgentTool(
    agent=image_generator_agent,
    description="Use this tool to generate an image. The input should be a descriptive prompt of the desired image.",
)


# 4. The parent agent remains unchanged. Its logic was correct.
artist_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="Artist",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    instruction=(
        "You are a creative artist. First, invent a creative and descriptive prompt for an image. "
        "Then, use the `ImageGen` tool to generate the image using your prompt."

## At a Glance

**What:** Complex problems often exceed the capabilities of a single, monolithic LLM-based agent. A solitary agent may lack the diverse, specialized skills or access to the specific tools needed to address all parts of a multifaceted task. This limitation creates a bottleneck, reducing the system's overall effectiveness and scalability. As a result, tackling sophisticated, multi-domain objectives becomes inefficient and can lead to incomplete or suboptimal outcomes.

> **是什么：** 复杂问题往往超出单体 LLM 智能体的能力边界；单一智能体可能不具备多面任务所需的多样化专精技能或工具权限，从而形成瓶颈，拖累整体效能与可扩展性，使跨领域的高阶目标难以高效达成或结果不尽如人意。

**Why:** The Multi-Agent Collaboration pattern offers a standardized solution by creating a system of multiple, cooperating agents. A complex problem is broken down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. Each sub-problem is then assigned to a specialized agent with the precise tools and capabilities required to solve it. These agents work together through defined communication protocols and interaction models like sequential handoffs, parallel workstreams, or hierarchical delegation. This agentic, distributed approach creates a synergistic effect, allowing the group to achieve outcomes that would be impossible for any single agent.

> **为什么：** 多智能体协作模式以「多智能体协同系统」提供典型解法：将复杂问题切分为更小单元，分别交由具备匹配工具与能力的专精智能体承接；在统一的通信协议下，通过顺序交接、并行工作流或层级委派等形态协同，产生整体大于部分之和的效应，取得任何单体难以独立完成的成果。

**Rule of thumb:** Use this pattern when a task is too complex for a single agent and can be decomposed into distinct sub-tasks requiring specialized skills or tools. It is ideal for problems that benefit from diverse expertise, parallel processing, or a structured workflow with multiple stages, such as complex research and analysis, software development, or creative content generation.

> **经验法则：** 当任务对单一智能体而言过于繁重，且可拆解为依赖不同技能或工具的子任务时，宜采用本模式；尤其适用于需要多元专长、并行加速或多阶段结构化流程的场景，例如复杂研究分析、软件开发或创意内容生产。
